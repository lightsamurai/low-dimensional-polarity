None that could hurt you, anyway. I've researched this topic extensively, and this is one of many common misconceptions about vaccines. You're probably referring to the public outcry that occurred when it was discovered that vaccines were being preserved with something called thimerosal, which contains a minute amount of mercury. That amount of mercury could not possibly hurt anyone in any way, and the vaccine manufacturers tried over and over to tell people this, but a strange mob mentally had built up after researcher Andrew Wakefield published a study claiming that he had might have found traces of the MMR vaccine in the intestines of autistic people, and nobody just wouldn't listen to reason. First of all, that study was poorly conducted in the first place, with a small sample size and unclear testing practices. Second, ALL of the other researchers originally attached to study eventually removed their support of it entirely. Third, Andrew Wakefield was disbarred from his practice and never a job related to medicine again. Finally, that study never even CLAIMED that there was any correlation between vaccines and autism, let alone cause and effect. It was simply stating a discovery. Now, when the public would not calm down about thimerosal, it obviously became a health concern that less people were vaccinating their children. So the manufacturers gave in and just switched to a preservative that didn't contain mercury to appease the masses. No vaccines in the U.S. contain mercury or other harmful metals. There was also concern about some vaccines using a preservative called formeldahyde. Maybe you've heard of it. It's what can sometimes be used to preserve organic material, like dead bodies. Like mercury, it is harmful if consumed in large quantities. I cannot speak to the current inclusion of this substance in vaccines as a preservative, but I do know that the amount found in one vaccine is not even equal to, but LESS THAN the amount found naturally in a single PEAR. So, unless you've never had a pear, you've injested much more formeldahyde in your lifetime than in a vaccine shot. That is, if they still use it. So there you have it.

In other words, they don't yet know why the boy died, but it may turn out to have nothing to do with the vaccination.\n\nI got into a bit of an argument with my mother on this and my argument to her was that if you consider that there are only 365 days in a year and that babies need immunizations 4 or 5 times a year for their first couple years of life, then that means there is as much as a 1 in 73 chance that if a baby died for *any reason*, they just so happened to die on the very day that they received a vaccination. In other words, for every 73 babies that die before the age of 2, there should be at least one of them that died on the day they were vaccinated.\n\nNow how many babies die worldwide in a given year? This story is from South Africa so the anti-vaxxers are using anything they can find from across the globe to support their beliefs. According to the World Health Organization, infant mortality (death under the age of 5) globally is roughly 29 out of every 1000 and 75% of those occur in the first year of life (when most vaccinations are received). So that's about 21 1-year-old deaths (rounded down) per 1000 births per year globally.\n\nA Google search shows that the global birth rate is 131.4 million births per year. This means that statistically speaking, 2.759 *Million* children should be dying on the same day that they receive vaccinations regardless of their actual cause of death. With numbers like that, I'm surprised we aren't hearing these anecdotes from anti-vaxxers more often than we already are.\n\nNow obviously, there are some remaining problems with these numbers. For example, not all children globally are going to get immunizations and if we assume that some non-zero number of vaccinations actually do kill children (which I'm sure is a counter-argument), then we would fully expect to see deaths on the same day as vaccination.\n\nAnti-vaxxers abuse these statistics too though, they usually will chalk up a fatality to vaccination not just if it occurs the day of, but even if it happens weeks or even months later. If you broaden the allowable time gap, you get many millions more potential anecdotes.\n\nI think the takeaway of all of this is what we already knew. Anecdotes are not a sufficient source of information for drawing conclusions. You need statistical data with control groups. Fortunately we already have that data.\n\nAt the end of the day though, anti-vaxxers don't care about numbers or statistics.

Also, Thiomersal (wich is a variant of mercury) is not dangerous for your body because it breaks down into ETHYL-MERCURY. Ethyl Mercury is something your body can get rid of, unlike pure mercury, wich does bioaccumulate. But pure mercury doesnt appear in vaccines. Thiomersal has been claimed with NO tangible evidence to be a cause of autism except for ONE researcher, but he hasnt based any of his conclusions on facts or reliable sources. He also lost his university degree and liscence for spreading a huge lie such as this.\n\nThe fact that some doctors support anti-vaxx simply is impossible. She couldn't name any that is actually a doctor in the medical field that got his degree from a legitimate university... She only says this because her antivaxx book/website says so.\n\nDown Syndrome cannot be linked to vaccines because it is not a disease you gain, it is a genetical disorder on your 21st chromosme pair. And it isn't even hereditary! If autism had a link with vaccines we would know by now because thousands of researches have been done already to try to find the cause of autism, we still do not know anything about it to this day except for the fact that it is something you are BORN with so vaccines cannot be a cause.\n\nAlso note one thing that I hear alot of Antivaxxers say: They like saying that vaccines alters your DNA. Altering DNA can only be done by some types of virus there is no way a simple flu shot could be possible to do this, and besides IF and I say IF vaccines WOULD alter DNA, Let me mention that 98% of the DNA in your cells do not code for polypeptide (basically a big waste of space believe it or not) so your DNA being altered  does not affect your body.\n\nIf your mother would like to come in contact with me to have a mature conversation I'll be more than glad to.

So screw the vaccine and all that.... Then I learned about shingles... Watched my friend suffer horrible pain and infect her small child because its highly courageous...and now her daughters face looks like a burn victim \n\n3)my mother had rheumatic fever as a child... So did a little girl down the street from her.

And the once happy healthy active child she was disappeared... I remember my mother being sickly my whole life. She had heart and lung issues that kept progressing to copd diagnosed in 2009 she ended up with horrible arthritis to the point she couldn't walk around the same time, and she told me back in 2016 that I should vaccinate because if she had not gotten the fever that killed the little girl down the block from her and left her sickly and bedridden most of her childhood maybe she would be able to do more with her grand kids.\nWe watched her die last year, literally watched her get given some strong pain killers so she wouldn't panic as her lungs gave out... take off the mask that was forcing air into her lungs and slowly stop living...ill never get the images of her last breath going out and never coming back in outta my mind....she died at 65...she should be hanging with grand babies not cold in the ground... \n4) I am against the large pharmacies, I'm against them abusing the fact people need drugs and vaccines to make a huge profit...I believe in science... I don't believe in the government all that much... But a friend who's all about conspiracy theories pointed out maybe it is a conspiracy theory how the whole anti vax movement started... (The original article being discredited by plenty of other scientist world wide btw) is big pharma trying to cause issues like my mothers...children who don't live long after reviving old age benefits...I mean she did survive long enough to be a \"slave worker to the man\" and died when she was no longer useful.\n \nMy main reason is I love my kids.

Which means 0.00000000005 grams\nPotassium chloride, which is a neurotoxin.... yeah. In LARGE QUANTITIES  just like sodium chloride. Which is table salt. Potassium chloride is a SALT REPLACER. And humans need more potassium so this is ENCOURAGED. Everything is toxic in high doses.\nAlso I looked up beta-propiolactone and it's carcinogenicity. It's only rated as 2B which is \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\". Which means limited evidence in humans and less than sufficient evidence in experimental animals or sufficient evidence in experimental animals. Meaning carcinogenicity hasn't been established in humans.\nAlso, you can literally buy potassium chloride at Walmart.\nCredit to my friend, who actually studied some toxicology in college for this.

Go online and try to research from their point of view. It won't work lol", "What research????. \nWHAT RESEARCH!", "This should be illegal. This shit is child abuse and kids will get sick and suffer while their moms claim to know more than doctors", "I think the above poster is correct in the sense that you're lacking a fundamental understanding of toxicology. The most basic understanding of toxicology realizes that \"the dose makes the poison\". Take, for example, the element selenium. A lack of selenium in the body (deficiency) can be detrimental. The deficiency can result in infertility, muscle weakness, hair loss, a weakened immune system, etc. However, high doses of selenium can be acutely and chronically toxic. Because it is toxic in too high of quantities, are we going to tell people to avoid it? No, because our health would suffer. Instead we advocate for well-balanced diets judicious use of nutritional supplements when necessary. \n\nSimilarly, carcinogenicity is complex. It is difficult to establish in humans because the concordance between animal studies and actual human results is not always strong. We rely on evidence from species with biological systems that differ from our own. Classification of carcinogenicity also varies with who analyzed the studies and how they are performed. Many of these studies use at least the maximum tolerable dose, which is magnitudes greater than we will ever be exposed to for many compounds. And the regulating bodies have very different understandings about what they feel makes something definitively a human carcinogen. There are things in California that are considered human carcinogens that the rest of the US does not consider to be definite human carcinogens. IARC and EPA differ in their classification as well. \n\nWe do use many compounds that are \"toxic\" for medical purposes. The difference is that those who evaluate the drug for its clinical use understand the significance of \"the dose makes the poison.\" Even essential oils that people use as an alternative to modern medicine actually impart toxicity in the correct quantity. Think about theobromine as well. The compound in chocolate that results in death in dogs. This is actually also a compound that can be toxic to humans, but, again, the dose matters and we aren't going to tell people not to eat chocolate because that quantity won't harm us.\n\nOverall, I think you'd really benefit from a course in toxicology if you're still in school. Studying vaccinology doesn't really qualify you to assess the safety of the ingredients of the vaccines. That is a toxicologist's job. You keep telling others to keep an open mind, but all the responses I've seen from you have been somewhat defensive and combative.

Now that we established everything is bad for you if its too high, does that automatically mean everything is harmless if its small? No, some things no matter how small are still toxic to you, your logic is flawed. Toxic substances are always toxic unless you change the chemical components of it therefore completely changing what it is, if its smaller it just means less damage not \"completely harmless\"", "Shit, I\u2019m vaccinated and I have scoliosis.

", "Bet she also considers herself \u201ccrunchy\u201d.", "I think you missed my point, but I can see you're on the verge of getting what I am saying. My point is exactly the same as your point on water. Everything is harmful in large quantities. This doesn't mean we can't use things with evidence of toxicity at particular doses in small quantities. There is a maximum tolerated dose for these things, and the levels permitted by the FDA are much, much lower. My entire argument is that the dose makes the poison. This is pretty much the mantra of every toxicologist I've ever had the pleasure of talking to or hearing a speech from. \n\nThe compounds that you're concerned about fall into the category of things that are not especially harmful in small quantities. Sure there are things that we shouldn't permit even in small quantities. Those things are heavily regulated by the FDA and certainly prohibited if their toxicity is high enough. Does that mean that the FDA makes the perfect call every time? No. But they certainly do the best they can. The point is, every chemical compound is tested in depth, and the relative toxicity is considered. I don't advocate for the use of anything regardless of toxicity just because small quantities are used. I advocate for judicious use of compounds in safe doses as established by professionals. Dose is immeasurably important to consider. There isn't a threat of acute toxicity from these compounds at the dosage used, otherwise we would see the reaction in those treated. Chronic toxicity is also not a concern for the majority of these at the dosages they're found at because the exposure is not chronic. Even the majority of carcinogens require repeated exposure or very high doses for carcinogenicity to occur. It's also notable that we regularly utilize compounds like Tylenol that would never be approved today by the FDA. People have just decided that the risk produced of taking Tylenol is outweighed by the benefits. The same is seen for vaccines. The incredibly minor risk posed by small doses of these compounds in vaccines does not outweigh the benefits vaccines have provided us by protecting us, our children, and those who are immunocompromised and depend on our immunity to ensure their own safety.\n\nOverall, what I'm saying isn't my own logic. It's the basic premise of toxicology that is at the heart of the study. The dose makes the poison. You said it yourself with water. The high dose is harmful. The low dose is not. These levels of toxicity vary for every compound and need to be considered individually. For many compounds there are even hometic dose response curves where small doses are harmful and large doses are harmful, but there is a beneficial dose in between. It's really fascinating and I recommend looking into it. There's a really great book called On Immunity an Inoculation by Eula Biss. She details her understanding of these concepts in a way anyone can reasonably understand, and she comes off as really fair. I would recommend the book. My final word on the topic is redundant, as it is the unofficial mantra of toxicology, and in studying toxicology you will hear it over and over: the dose makes the poison. You will most certainly learn some degree of toxicology if you pursue a career in medicinal chemistry, as medicinal chemists work closely with toxicologists to ensure the safety and efficacy of the compounds they create.

It shocks me to see people that think like this because any logic at all will put the basic information together that vaccines are harmless. The chemicals they contain are there for a reason, and the amount is so small it's nowhere near toxic. By the way, the chemicals aren't the only thing that's toxic in the world, anything can be toxic at a large enough dosage. You eat more aluminum from food daily than one vaccine. Mercury is rarely used in vaccines anymore even though it was harmless when it was used. The paper linking autism and vaccines was revoked. Plenty Thousands of studies and tests prove vaccines are helpful. This kind of information from actual experts should assure anyone. It's just exaggerated stories and uneducated people spreading more and more false information. One person is allergic to a vaccine and doesn't know it, and as soon as they react badly to the vaccine, they let everyone know how bad every vaccine is. Survival stories from people who only lived because of vaccines are buried. It's so disappointing to see people think every scientist is controlled by a hidden agenda to hurt the public.

X", "Let me explain why this image is dangerous, but first, why it is almost certainly a HOAX:\n\n1. **anonymous**: while anonymizing posts is usually important (imagine the flogging this mom would get if she existed and we knew her name), we must also admit it allows for hucksters to create fake facebook posts. [There](http://www.prankmenot.com/?facebook_full_chat) are [many](http://simitator.com/generator/facebook/status) sites that [offer](https://zeoob.com/generate-facebook-status-post/) this to pranksters. That alone should raise your eyes.\n\n2. **corroboration**: Does the date of [death match any CDC cases within that date range?](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html) Even in the same range? [New York cases](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/measles.page),  [Oregon case](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/ConfirmedcaseofmeaslesinMultnomahCountylinkedtoWashingtonstateoutbreak.aspx), [Rockland cases](http://rocklandgov.com/departments/health/press-releases/2019-press-releases/measles-outbreak-is-not-over/), [Rochester cases](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/amp/news/local-news/2-measles-cases-surface-in-monroe-county/1728570674?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter_News_8&amp;__twitter_impression=true), [Washington cases](https://www.doh.wa.gov/YouandYourFamily/IllnessandDisease/Measles/MeaslesOutbreak), [Brooklyn cases](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/measles.page). There is no evidence of deaths in that range. To be fair, I am limited by the fact that, to be thorough, i'd have to search every source across the entire country, and that's just not practical! How about news reports about this? If it were real, wouldn't at least a local news agency (or the CDC) discuss it, even if anonymously? \n\nSecond, let me explain why this is dangerous:\n\n1. **confirmation bias**: reading something that confirms your bias is more likely to lead to accepting this as further proof that your bias is an accurate depiction of reality. When I first saw this thread, it boiled my blood, but I've since learned to question something that gets my goat so easily... and I did a few searches. This discipline takes effort, and it's not always foolproof. Many folks who read this today will go away thinking it happened, or at least it accurately represents anti vaccination folks. Maybe it does, but unless we have evidence of it actually happening, a (likely) fictional post should not be the 'evidence' of our belief/bias.\n2. **true advocates should seek evidence, not be like the anti-vaxxers they criticize**: I thought the idea was to point out the folly of unscientific, anecdotal, conspiracy-minded thinking that makes up most anti vaccination thinkers. Yet aren't we conspiring to calumny the entire group with false evidence? Even if this image is not a proven hoax yet, many are only too happy to let it boil your blood rather than laugh it off as a possible hoax.\n3. **why didn't the u/xgeorgehallx preface the post with (UNVERIFIED)**? when you post something potentially inflammatory you should at least take care. A common defense is the assumption that as a poster, YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLY FAKE, OTHERS SHOULD TOO. But we cannot rely on humans to think like we do. When in doubt, remind folks of the caveats of your post.\n\nI know it's a losing battle to [question every source](https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/06/26/dont-believe-everything-you-read-on-the-internet-and-6-ways-to-be-more-skeptical/), but I still think it has some value to remind others... if only because it's ever so easy for a hoax to spread and cause harm.\n[As Lincoln once said](https://imgur.com/9vDa45V) ;) ", "it ok they will just make more\n\n ", "What S.P.E.C.I.A.L. category would you choose to invest your points in?", "p\u0311\u030e\u031c\u035a\u0359\u0330\u0356l\u036b\u0309\u0368\u036b\u0347\u035aa\u0344\u034c\u0303\u036d\u030a\u0300\u0356\u033a\u0317\u032c\u033b\u0329\u0323c\u0355\u0323\u0330e\u030a\u0367\u034c\u0313\u032e\u0347\u031c\u032d\u032eb\u036d\u0352\u033e\u0353\u0348\u0332\u033bo\u0363\u0367\u0309\u0366\u033a \u0314\u0350\u0348\u033c\u0316\u033b\u0348\u0349a\u0314\u034a\u036b\u0357\u0344\u036f\u0330\u0329\u035a\u0324\u0316\u031d\u0331u\u030b\u0357\u031a\u030d\u0308\u0359\u0318\u0326\u0323\u0320\u0331\u0355t\u036b\u036d\u034c\u034a\u0346\u0353\u034ei\u0304\u0303\u034b\u036c\u0308\u0301s\u036a\u033d\u0344\u036bm\u030d\u0365\u033f\u030c\u0359\u031d\u0333\u0326\u0318", "Counselling for anti-vaxxers (also saw this notification and at first thought it was a \u201ctrending on r/askreddit\u201d thing,, got so confused)", "Do YoUR OwN rEseArCh", "some cases of autisim dont show until 12 to 18 months so, just sayin...", "Any questions?", "Are you talking too me or the anti vaxxers?", "Thanks for endangering a good chunk of those who arent old enough too be vaccinated, KAREN.", "You may have an autistic mental disorder, but her's sounds like she's just batshit crazy.

I just strongly believe there should be better and more accurate testing because private companies are taking these vaccines and running authentic tests and coming up with some crazy results. \n\nBut hey.

Example: chicken pox. Growing up, it wasn\u2019t such a scary thing, I got it and stayed home and had fun. I would much rather have my daughter get it young since it\u2019s dangerous to get it as adults.\nRegarding my daughters health, she hardly gets sick like no cold, flu, measles, cough..

You might wanna avoid sexual contact before then if you're that afraid of HPV (you might have to save your money up, though.  Gardasil is ridiculously expensive). \n\nThe one you might wanna get immediately is the Meningitis ACWY vax.  Not that meningitis is that common, but it is particularly deadly, with a one-in-10 chance of dying from it, and another 20% chance of permanent physical injury (including amputation) if you get the disease.  It's most common in teens, they say - who share drinks, food, and close space in other ways.  \n\nThis, to me, is the one you might wanna fight for.  \n\nThe flu shot... well.

My argument is that extra ingredients are added into vaccines that are not nessacary that do cause harm to people, these ingredients I have listed for example above are proof of that because they are shown to be toxic to humans, some are carcinogenic. So if you would like to speak of studies then prove to me that all of my research and personal findings are wrong and that the ingredients I have listed are healthy and safe and will be beneficial when injecting them. \n\nAlso, another re-clarification is that most diseases eradicated or endangered are because of a natural process called adaptation. How else do you think we overcame plagues back before vaccines and survived? Over generations of surviving diseases and being exposed to the earths worse we grow more immune, we are more durable than ever and that will only continue. \n\nI say this because although I know that vaccines can help from my study of the science behind it as a vaccinologist and toxicologist some vaccines I analyzed made no sense such has the flu vaccine. I haven't seen studies that shows the flu vaccine helped with anything flu related unlike other vaccines. The flu vaccine needs to be eradicated, don't miss out on your vaccinations but I urge you to not get your yearly flu vaccine since the flu is not deadly and the vaccine has no proven benefits to immunity.", "I\u2019d hide you if you tried to feed me tofu and Greek yogurt, too.

If they were harmful like you mention why is the risk and incidence of vaccination injury so miniscule. With most of those injuries do to allergies, not toxic poisoning.  Secondly there was no single 'plauge', it was a few differnt diseases and adaption took over 200 years to develop, even then the natural immunity to those diseases is tenuous at best.  If you dont believe so, go ahead and see about exposing yourself to it and see what happens. Even with antibotic for the bubonic plague the mortality rate is greater the 1 in 10 with modern treatments.  Other kinds classified as the plague have mortality rates up to %95.  Large outbreaks occured up into the early 1900s. This is besides the point because they were mostly all bacterial, thus vaccines have nothing to do with it. There is a direct line between deaths due to small pox, cow pox, chicken pox, measels and polio and the advent and wide use of vaccines. Such a great decline that it can not be attributed to natural adaption in such a sort time period. People dont evolve that quickly.  Thirdly it doesnt even sound like you know how the flu vaccines works (there is no single 'flu') while it is the least effective form of vaccine (do to having to guess which strains of flu will be prevalent in certain areas) it still have proven to be more effective then nothing, and rates of injury are lower then deaths attributed to flu. You keep metioning a back ground in health and science but have yet to give any scientific data or evidence to your claims that the ingredients in vaccines, in the specific formula used, administered correctly, by professionals are dangerous.

Poison is still poison, if you lower the dosage you're making it less poisonous. When did I ever say taking vaccines will cause noticable injury or death? It won't, no noticable damage will be done, you won't notice it. It's slow and gradual, but the ingredients are not good for you even in small amounts. I have dealt with doses lower than listed in certain vaccines and I've had to wear two pairs of gloves and it still hurt healthy blood cells during my testing.\n\nFurthermore, the burden of proof lies on you. You are the party injecting me with something, so prove I should consent to it. I already stated vaccines work expect the flu vaccine from my test, so I'm convinced on that but prove that every single toxin, neruotoxin, and carcinogen in this vaccine have a positive benefit at lower dosages and then prove that the current dosage used is in that range.

Further, the way antivaxers are demonized made me think of pro-vax advocates as untrustworthy jerks.\n\nI still think conflicts of interest are a concern, yesterday I found a review of the evidence regarding the safety of aluminum adjuvants, which said aluminum in vaccines is safe, but it was written by the head of a vaccine company!\n\nI also am concerned about the way that people are so afraid to cause a scare about vaccines that they don't research or disclose side effects as they should[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/opinion/sunday/anti-vaccine-activists-have-taken-vaccine-science-hostage.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/opinion/sunday/anti-vaccine-activists-have-taken-vaccine-science-hostage.html), and the recent censorship fad is no good either, but I am not against vaccination, although I can point out many bogus pro-vax talking points:\n\n1: \"There is more aluminum in food than vaccines\" Despite the obvious stupidity of this argument, prominent doctors use it, making them seem untrustworthy.

He went on to say how he is especially concerned about those with undiagnosed immune deficiencies who don't even know they have to take extra precautions during an outbreak. He has a point, but it left me wondering \"what about when those with undiagnosed immune deficiencies get vaccinated\"?

You want the body to be producing its own circulating anti-rabies immunoglobulin as soon as possible.  However, that may take up to two weeks to begin and so the other important component of post-exposure prophylaxis is to administer anti-rabies immunoglobulin around the site of the bite.  So this product is infused into the tissue around the wound to \u201csoak up\u201d as many virus particles as possible while the patient\u2019s immune system begins to produce its own antibodies.\n\nSo when you hear about people getting a bunch of injections around the site of the wound, that\u2019s the antibody.  The vaccine is given in the shoulder (or the thigh in very young children) and never in the buttock (it is less effective there).  If there is any remaining immunoglobulin, it needs to be administered in a different muscle from the vaccine (usually the opposite shoulder).\n\nThe vaccine is a pretty harsh one.

However there is a 60 billion dollar per year industry pushing a narrative that vaccines are unequivocally safe. That is not true. Billions have been paid to compensate for adverse vaccine reactions including brain damage. According to HHS only 1 percent  of vaccine reactions are reported. \n\nhttps://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf\n\nScience does not support the proposition that these products are 100% necessary and safe, but in fact suggests they are the root of the epidemic of autism and auto immune disease we face in the US. Take a look at HBV.\n\nRecent studies from a top Chinese university have shown a potential link between HBV vaccine given after birth and autism/neurological impairment. These are the first studies of their kind. This 2016 mice study shows significant neurological effects from just one round of the hep b vaccine:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27501128/\n\nThis well sourced paper explains the importance of animal studies in analyzing vaccine toxicity:\n\n[http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Animal-Studies.pdf](http://vaccinesafetycommission.com/pdfs/Animal-Studies.pdf)\n\nThe 2016 mice study speaks for itself:\n\n\u201cThis work reveals for the first time that early HBV vaccination induces impairments in behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. This work provides innovative data supporting the long suspected potential association of HBV with certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and multiple sclerosis.\u201d\n\nThis is testing ONE vaccine. Not the cumulative effect of the combined aluminum injected into children under the ever increasing modern vaccine schedule. A 2018 follow up study on the mechanics of this process found the following:\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that clinical events involving neonatal IL-4 over-exposure, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and asthma in human infants, may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral development.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29751176/\n\nPaul Patterson's research at Caltech supports the proposition that a vaccine induced immune activation event could lead to autism and other neurological dysfunction.\n\nhttp://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4166/\n\nHep B vaccine has never been through a placebo controlled safety trial, or any long-term clinical safety trial  that would  uncover long-term neurological damage caused by this vaccine. We give it  to every child  born in America  on the first day of life.  However the vaccine  has no utility in infants born to Hepatitis B negative mothers  because they will not be exposed to the disease vectors that spread Hepatitis B(sex and needles)  until at least adolescence. This is a dangerous largely untested vaccine with no benefit to most infants, and developed countries that do not use it have better health outcomes than the US.\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-has-highest-first-day-infant-mortality-out-of-industrialized-world-group-reports/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-has-highest-first-day-infant-mortality-out-of-industrialized-world-group-reports/)\n\n[https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/1/8/16863656/childhood-mortality-united-states](https://www.vox.com/health-care/2018/1/8/16863656/childhood-mortality-united-states)\n\nHBV is one vaccine we should probably take off the schedule.

Therefore, the article [see title] argues effect is **transient** not permanent.\n\n[Neonatal hepatitis B vaccination impaired the behavior and neurogenesis of mice **transiently** in early adulthood.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501128/)\n\nAlso note the developmental timecourse of mice and humans is not the same. The article you linked seems to imply **human children** will be affected by the HBV whereas the article only claims it affects **early adult mice.** If the results are true, and if the results can he extended to humans, as mice develop more quickly.\n\nYou cannot assume the affect will be noted in adolescent humans, for example, nor can you assume it will occur 8 weeks after inoculation as your article seems to imply.\n\nFurthermore, I don\u2019t know much about the vaccination timeline, but it seems very strange: they vaccinate at much more disparate times than for humans to match a human\u2019s slower developmental trajectory at each booster:\n\n&gt;HBV was administered in a three dose series. The time points for immunization of newborn mice imitated those for human infants, with P0-P7-P21 imitating P0-P30-P180. \n\nTherefore, the mouse immune system was challenged in three discreet instances as opposed to in one swoop (assuming \u201cP0...\u201d Stands for postnatal day 0, 7, and 21, as it is generally used). I don\u2019t know about HepB or boosters, but the [CDC has already found that delaying vaccines (as they seem to be? for these mice) results in more frequent temporary vaccination side effects](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/delaying-vaccines-increases-risks-with-no-added-benefits/), like febrile seizure for MMR (stick with the schedule, everyone!). However, none of these side effects relate to large-scale LTP or neurogenesis changes.\n\nThey are also using an inbred mouse line to model a heterogeneous human population. There are two schools of thought regarding this in research, and immunology isn\u2019t really my specialty, but here are my thoughts:\n\n1) Some scientists like inbred mice because it reduces variability between samples. It enables quick comparison of a phenotype or response between mice of the same strain.\n\n2) Some scientists hate inbred lines because they\u2019re all genetically f*cked up in some way. C57Bl/6J are prone to age related hearing loss. C57Bl/6N are prone to blindness. Some of the albino strains have a screwed up immune system. Some black strains are prone to obesity. It turns out, the response to this vaccine (according to the study) is known to have a Th2 bias, but the mouse line they used is known to be Th1 dominant. How does this affect the results, knowing that different human populations have different Th1/2 biases and why would you choose a mouse line known be Th1 dominant? \n\nAnd, perhaps counter to anti-vas arguments, the group found an opposing result in a previous study with maternal influenza vaccine:\n\n&gt;\tOur recent studies showed that maternal influenza vaccination increased the levels of hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophin expression in both generations and that these neurobenefits were positively associated with a systemic Th1 bias\n\n*\n\n&gt;Moreover, BCG [Bacullis Calmette Gu\u00e9rin] vaccine against Tuberculous Meningitis] is a well known Th1 bias inducer that has been found to be neuroprotective.\n\nThis \n1) provides a possible explanation for why they used C57Bl6 (for the Th1 bias) \n\n2) Implies that if different vaccinations provide similar effects on fetal/infant immune systems, the author\u2019s qualm is **not with the vaccination** (which protects against the only preventable form of hepatitis virus: Hep B\u2014the other, Hep C, requiring 6 months of a daily $1,000/pill medication and previously required you to feel like you literally had the flu for 12 months [interferon]; Hep B treatment requires a daily similarly priced pill as well) but the **timeline**, as influenza was actually beneficial to neurogenesis*, assuming you actually care about transient changes that have no measured effect long term.\n\n*Because both of these results (maternal influenza vaccine and neonatal Hep B) were compared to control, I\u2019m assuming neurogenesis is benedicial in this instance, which isn\u2019t always the case.\n\nP.S. Can anyone explain **what** LTP (Long Term Potentiation) they are measuring? (They give coordinates, but not the identity of the cells they\u2019re recording from.) Can you measure gross/average LTP of the entire perforant pathway, from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus? Is that what they\u2019re doing? \n\nThis could be a genuine goof on my part, but I\u2019ve only seen a circuits-based approach to LTP analysis as it is a form of cellular learning.

The doc seems spot on then :-)", "Not clear on what you intentions are, but I will throw out a few items. I personally appreciate you are speaking up, and want to put it as simply as possible, please educate yourself on how the immune system works, on the widely unknown history of vaccines, on the amount of injuries occurring directly caused by vaccines, on the amount of research on harmful adjuvants and how aluminum, for instance, is related to a plethora of problems, etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd, please learn about how well the body compensates and adapts and how we do not have a measure for what these foreign elements passing natural immune barriers are actually doing to people's bodies and brains long before observable and identifiable injury is present. \n\nCase in point, some cancers can eat away 50% of bone before it is even observable on radiology. Did the cancer just appear out of nowhere? Nope, it was eating away for a long time and then finally when it was severe enough, it was detectable. \n\nHow many people are walking around with undetected decreased bodily function? Decreased brain and neurological function? Etc. \n\nThere is no test to take, no exam to perform...\n\nHow many people are just thinking Bob is \"slow\", or Suzie just has an \"autoimmune issue\" because of the \"luck of the draw\", and it is actually from something that caused it and which could have been prevented?  That is a tragic thought that it seems many do not want to confront.\n\nThe CONCEPT of vaccination makes sense. But, it really is backwards in relation to the the much bigger issue of how the immune system functions. And, it is a huge misnomer about people wanting more information, research and studies on vaccines. They are labelled as anti something when it is not the actual concept of vaccine that someone is against, but the observable detriment that has been attributed, for instance,  to the chemical adjuvants included in vaccines. It is about wanting safety, not the concept of vaccination.  I have heard people say, \"I believe in vaccines!\" Well, so does anyone. Now how about believing in the concept of making sure they are not hurting people.\n\nThe way vaccinations are done today is atrocious. The damages they are causing are covered up, it's just a sad fact.  We want to trust our information resources, but many are failing us. Check out this new and interesting open letter to a journalist:\n\n [https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/flu-misinformation-and-coronavirus-fears-my-letter-to-dr-sanjay-gupta/](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/flu-misinformation-and-coronavirus-fears-my-letter-to-dr-sanjay-gupta/)\n\nMany people are regurgitating whatever sound bites they heard as \"fact\". And, they equally state adamantly and confidently the same information. The power of people's commitment to something they simply accepted from some \"authority\", and without doing their own intellectual research, is amazing. \n\nAs vaccines are practiced currently, we don't even have a clue how bad vaccines are for us. When sued to get the info (FOIA), the CDC only presented 20 studies showing where they take their stance that vaccines do not cause Autism and the Highwire show here ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCckUQgbyd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCckUQgbyd8))  presented how all 20 of these failed. It seems good evidence that the claim by the CDC is absurd. Please watch the video. \n\nAs I have heard it said in may ways, no one learns about vaccines and then goes backward again to being pro-vaccine. It's just not possible. \n\nHopefully, you are not another sad troll paid by pro-pharma interests   with manipulative intentions. That would be horrible.\n\nIf not, again, I respect your opinion, but really encourage you to learn so much more. Even, a little more, would take you a long way.  It is nothing personal for you as a person with autism. Most people want all people to have the best quality of life possible for them, no matter where they are. \n\nIn the spirit of gentle encouragement and thankfulness.", "No so deep. An autistic person can grasp and emote a faulty belief as much as anyone. You seem pretty confident. Boiling blood notwithstanding, it has NOT been proven that it does not. There is direct observation saying it has and does. I mean, tell a parent who witnessed this firsthand that it did not happen to their own child. There is no way it won't be proven sometime soon. The stuff in vaccines are just too destructive. It's a no brainer that aluminum, for instance, is going to pass the blood brain barrier.  If brain cancer drugs can, why wouldn't this? No matter how they try to convince you there is no link, can your rational mind deny aluminum is not supposed to be in the brain?  It is being found in the brain in higher amounts in people with autism. As funding AND proper research is increasing and honest and independent research is performed, it will probably have multiple avenues of proof, because, it is not a simple linear event. Nothing in physiology is. When it is, you might feel pretty silly, as will everyone who will be feeling horribly mislead, because it should have been represented that we do not know for sure. You seem to heard someone say with a confident demeanor, \"no relation\", while laughing condescendingly. It's pretty effective, when people want so much to trust \"authorities\" of information and do not want to feel uneducated or foolish. But, do your own research of the history of vaccines. It is not what I simply assumed it was my whole life. I would advise sitting patiently quiet and observe what is developing, rather than regurgitating things unknown.

The key is to take an individual situation and assess for this person, what is the risk of polio versus the risk of autism. What mandatory approaches do is try to give every person in the world the exact same thing. This is going directly against where the development of health care is going, as I mentioned. The phrase is one size fits all. With what we know, that is an insane approach. You have to look at the real statistics about polio, as well. Please do an in depth research and study on the history of polio. And then , please read what you can about how many people are injured via vaccines that we even are aware of. Government agencies have indicated the VAERS only receives approximately 1-6% of actual cases. Still, our government has paid out $ 4 Billion, plus.  There are so many information points to cover, you just have to have a discussion with someone and then do your own research. No one is saying polio is not bad.

However, with a vaccine, there's a very good chance for vulnerable people to never experience the worst of it. If we can get the vaccine out within the year (which is really pushing it) they maybe be able to catch the tail end of this and prevent the vulnerable people from taking up hospital resources.\n\nThe only issue is how many of the vulnerable get infected during the time we are waiting. Hence why governments are insisting on isolation to reduce the number of people in hospital needing medical intervention and buy time in hopes of a medical breakthrough on the vaccines.

And after different procedures and different vaccine doses were used, all participants in the vaccine group had high antibodies. \n \nIndividuals who received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart were observed to achieve a 100% neutralizing antibody-positive conversion rate. According to the CNBG, the Phase I/II clinical trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. On April 12, the vaccine received the world's first approval for a clinical trial and Phase I/II clinical trials were initiated in Wuzhi County, Henan Province. \n \nClinical trials conducted over 66 days\n \nUnder the direction and guidance of the Henan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the clinical trials were conducted on 66 consecutive days. This allowed data to be collected on the safety and efficacy of the inactivated vaccine COVID-19 after two injections. \n \nSubjects received two injections\n \nAccording to CNBG, the study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 59 years at low, medium and high doses and injections at 14, 21 and 28 day intervals. The study focused on the changes in cellular immunity after vaccination and investigated vaccination procedures, vaccination dose, safety, immunogenicity and changes in antibody levels in vivo.

Surely they should be jumping up and down to do these tests, given how safe vaccines apparently are...", "Engiish version\n \nProfessor Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen is testing the Covid 19 vaccine developed by the company CureVac in a clinical study. In the podcast \"Klartext Corona\" he explains how such a study works and by when the vaccine can be approved at the earliest. 23 Vaccines have so far been tested in clinical trials worldwide. One of them was developed by the T\u00fcbingen-based company CureVac. Several independent university hospitals are now testing whether this vaccine is effective and compatible with humans.\n \nFor example, the Tropical Institute at the University Hospital in T\u00fcbingen. Peter Kremsner, head of the study, and his team have just injected the vaccine into the first volunteers. \n \nKremsner is optimistic about the course of the study: \"It is progressing very well: We hope to have the first results from phase 1 in about two months' time, when the vaccine will be tested on younger, healthy volunteers. Then phase 2 will begin with older volunteers who belong to the risk group, and if possible, phase 3 will start this year, in which efficacy and tolerability will be tested in a particularly affected country. Everything is completely in line with the rules, despite the significantly accelerated procedures: \"I am sure that all standards of the regulatory authorities and ethics committees in the European Union are met - everything must be correct in detail as always, but it must all happen very, very quickly.\n \nProvisional approval possible at the end of the year\n \nAt the end of the winter, he believes that there could be a provisional approval for the vaccine, which could then be administered at the beginning of the year. Currently, there are approximately 200 vaccine candidates. At the same time, production capacities are being increased worldwide. Kremsner believes that there will be a whole range of vaccines, and that this is a good thing: \"These can then be made available to broad sections of the population all over the world and thus make real control of Covid-19 possible.", "English version\n \nHans Sijbesma, head of the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Germany, believes that his company is well positioned in the research for a corona vaccine, and in an interview with the \"Neue Osnabr\u00fccker Zeitung\" he said: \"We hope to receive data from the first phase I/II study in Great Britain in the coming months and results from the larger phase II/III studies in autumn this year. But this will depend on the rate of infection within the clinical trial communities.\"\n \nThey hope that the vaccine is safe and effective, but they have to wait for the results of the clinical trial programme. The pharmaceutical company has teamed up with the University of Oxford to develop and then distribute a vaccine. According to Sijbesma, the company has secured the worldwide supply capacity for more than two billion doses of the vaccine, including some for Germany. \"Europe now has a commitment to receive up to 400 million doses of the vaccine. Production of the vaccine will take place mainly in several European countries,\" says the pharmaceutical boss. \n \nCompetition among vaccine manufacturers\n \nSijbesma is not afraid of competition from other vaccine manufacturers. \"We hope and expect that other vaccines will be available in the future, which means that there will be competition. This would also be good to ensure that we have a global supply as soon as possible and also to keep prices under control,\" says the head of pharmaceuticals.", "Attach here the Scientific Studies that support what you say.", "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/", "There is no TB vaccine approved in the US.", "i am not anti vaccine.\n\nIf you all just care to look up, vaccine development throughout the decades, you will find there have been harmfull vaccines.

Normally with medical research, there are a few things that tend to slow down the process considerably. One is funding and resources. Normally researchers are spending half their time, especially in the beginning, just trying to get funding for their research. It's months of writing proposals to organizations and research grant requests, and they might get just enough to work on their project. It's why things like the American Cancer Society is always asking for donations, there's never enough funding. With this, however, research groups got blank checks and whatever resources they needed out of the gate, no need to scrounge for funding. Another time sink they run into nowadays is the review boards. Normally when doing a medical research project, you'll write your initial proposal and send it to the review board. Once you get approval you'll work on your initial experimentations, then send those results back to the review board. Then it's your first stage of trials and back to the review board. Then second and third and so forth stage of trials, results always being overseen by these review boards in between. Problem is that under normal circumstances, getting an approval from a review board can take months, up to a year. Not because there's anything wrong with your study, they just normally have a lot of studies to review, and sometimes other studies are deemed more important, or groups are donating the right amount of money to the right people to get certain studies on the top of the review pile. Didn't work that way with this.

I really appreciate the feedback.  Out here in the sticks, few people have gotten the vaccine (which is why I was able to,  as a lower-risk-of-exposure provider, because of all the extra vaccine in my clinic).  Even a few of the nurses I work with have been eye-rollingly goofy about \"micro-chips\" and anti-science nonsense.\n\nI would up getting the second Pfizer shot yesterday morning (before I read the most recent comments below).  My goal was to get it to prevent me from transmitting COVID to my family from work.  Yesterday afternoon I learned I was actually exposed by an presymptomatic family member (g strain) a few days before the second shot.  This family member also infected a few other family members I care for, who have since also tested positive.  Now the people I was trying to protect have exposed me, haha!  I continue to have weird symptoms, including body and joint aches, intermittent sore throat, occasional sneezing, and a body temp of about 37.2c/99f (not really a fever).  I also have some other weird stuff going on hormonally but it is not related to anything infectious (may explain the slightly high body temp though).  I  called our work COVID line last night after work and got tested again today.  Hopefully this is just a mild vaccine reaction, and I really doubt I have COVID.  I will update on here about my results, since if I am negative these are probably vaccine reaction symptoms.  Maybe the vaccine protected me, despite the weird reaction I've had to it!\n\nMy question now it - how long should I wait with these joint pains before contacting my doctor about it being a vaccine reaction?  I don't want to be a hypochondriac.  Online sources say 2-6 weeks, or if they do not get better.  However, most of the evidence-based sites like the CDC seem to say the reactions are mild (presumably to get more people to take it, which I completely understand) or only mention anaphylaxis (which I did NOT have).  It's been a bit shy of 3 weeks now with joint pain now, but my fatigue has greatly reduced.

While I appreciate the general consensus that corners have apparently not been cut, I find the explanation of how technology and funding has made this possible a bit flaky. My reasons for this is that only two months before Britain announced it was approving the Pfizer one, everyone was laughing at the idea of a vaccine by November (due to political posturing of course). Similar hilarity was had at the concept of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Suddenly, after the UK announcement, in my opinion, the story appeared to change dramatically and this news of how vast breakthroughs in technology and funding have allowed the standard \\~12 years to be condensed into 1. Even Fauci spoke out but soon changed his story. I find it hard to believe he was suddenly given a body of knowledge as to how process and technology were improved and therefore, how hes wrong.\n\nMy issue with this story is that, if this was always the case, why weren't we championing the new technology and funding available throughout the  development process. Many politicians and experts were warning the public that vaccines wouldn't be possible till Spring 2021 minimum. Also, on the UK front, Brexit was in it's final days and it was beneficial to approve a vaccine long before Europe's EMA could to demonstrate how Britain's newfound \"Freedom\" was not just beneficial, but lifesaving.\n\nI'm a strong believer in the benefits of vaccines myself so not a anti-axxer by any stretch. Just last year I completed a three dose Hepatitis B vaccine regime as I was working in healthcare and this is a necessity for the work. In addition, I have had all my juvenile vaccines and such.\n\nMy key suspicion surrounding this vaccine is the motivation for which it was made, to rescue an ailing Western economy amidst a nebulous rise of the Chinese economy. I refuse to believe governments are running these vaccines for the preservation of human life alone, people are out of work, there's no tax coming in and public healthcare is struggling. The economy must be saved, which, in some ways, is a valid argument and needs to be tackled.\n\nI believe you have every right to be cautious, any logical, critical thinking human being would. However, there are many insane conspiracy nuts and antivaxx groups that are peddling pure nonsense on one side, and on the other, governments and pharmaceutical companies evangelizing these vaccines as \"Hope\" or \"The end in site\" with some very rudimentary proof thus far. To whit, Edward Bernay's \"Little torches of Freedom\" line comes to mind.\n\nWhile I am pro vaccine, I strongly advise against forced vaccination which many are calling for. I simply don't believe that's ethical or advisable to ensure a high uptake in this emergency.\n\nWhatever you decide, I wish you good health and good luck!

Most importantly, **there is an ethical argument to support vaccinations** of these populations. Public health might be tax funded, but leaving vulnerable communities to suffer is not something we signed up to do. Vaccines are still a medical intervention, and after putting healthcare providers and public health departments through the trauma of this pandemic, are we really going to turn around them as ask them to refuse vaccines to people? To refuse vaccines to people who look like the patients whose hands they held as they passed away? Who might even be family or friends or community members of those patients??\n\n**And if an ethical argument can't convince you,  here is an evidence based one. **\n\nBringing citizenship status into it politicizes vaccinination. Public health is concerned about the health of the population, and not the population on paper (i.e. citizens or taxpayers) but the *actual physical* population that exists in this country. The COVID-19 pandemic *spreads physically* and has reached every community, and so we must intervene on every community. The only way out of this pandemic is by building herd immunity, and to do that we must also include those vulnerable communities. Other interventions like lockdowns are dependent on negative outcomes in all communities, not just taxpayers, so if we want out of this pandemic, they need to get vaccinated and also have herd immunity. Sure, you could be protected first, but short and long term, vulnerable populations having low rates of vaccine coverage is a bigger risk for public health than you being unvaccinated is. So we are focusing on intervening in vulnerable populations and attempting to have some equity when it comes to vaccinations and public health.

When yoy get vaccinated you will get paperwork state that the vaccine is not approved, and it is being given under emergency use ONLY.  THis is the most likely one that will go to the courts.

These are the people that REALLY REALLY need to have the vaccine.  They are at an elevated risk.  After it hit 66%, NY  expanded who was eligible because appointments were going unfilled. So what I take away from that is  that less than 66% people take the vaccine.  If only 66% of people who really needed it signed up, people who  do need it less will be less likely to take it.

There is no reason for me to fear a virus or a vaccine. I'll tell you what I do fear though. When I went to the hospital because I couldn't stop coughing and I wanted to make sure my baby was ok, I didn't have a fever or anything and I looked fine so the ER nurse was convinced that I couldn't have the flu and sent me up to the maternity ward prior to testing me. She was worried with all the flu patients in the ER that I could get it from them. Well here's the issue: I could have killed one of the other mothers in that part of the hospital. The risk of death from the flu increases when a woman is pregnant. I want no part in spreading something that could harm people who aren't as lucky as I am. That's why I got the first dose of Moderna the day before yesterday.", "A [peer-reviewed study](https://bcmj.org/articles/what-evidence-extending-sars-cov-2-covid-19-vaccine-dosing-schedule) in the March 2021 BC Medical Journal found that \"based on unpublished data available to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization through Health Canada for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, there was no difference in vaccine efficacy between the people who got their second dose at day 19 and the people who got it at day 42.... Despite the paucity of clinical trial data, it is likely that increasing the interval between the first and second doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna is safe, both in the intervening period between doses and for long-term efficacy.\"", "You can go to independent health centers in your area and find out if they are running an on site vaccination program. The .gov websites direct me to the mass vaccination center, which has J&amp;J.\n\nSomeone gave me a tip that there was a local health center that had Moderna, so I went online and filled out the application. It was very hard: the website was hanging and I had to redo the application many many times, it would freeze and make you restart as well. But I kept trying and eventually (after being admitted as a new patient and going through a separate registration process - weeks) I was given an appointment. 2nd dose is already scheduled, so I\u2019m really glad I didn\u2019t end up having to go to the mass site. I work with kids, so I like that it protects them too. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d actually be okay with the J&amp;J if it was the only one available to me.

The last Moderna numbers I saw were 94.1% effective against infection. The studies were smaller than the J&amp;J.

While a one-dose shot may be more convenient, it\u2019s important to remember that all available vaccines provide safe and effective protection against COVID-19. You can feel confident in taking the vaccine first available to you whether you are offered a one-dose or two-dose vaccine.\n\n#5: The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine does not contain the virus that causes COVID-19. Here\u2019s how it works.\nScientists have used adenovirus, the shell of the virus, to carry the gene, or DNA, for the coronavirus spike protein into your cells so that antibodies can be produced. The adenovirus has been modified so that it can enter cells but cannot replicate to make you sick with a cold. The DNA quickly degrade in the human body and does not affect human chromosomes. When injected, the adenovirus causes production of the spike protein and immunity is created against COVID-19. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine cannot cause infection.\n\n#6: The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine can help us stop the spread of COVID-19 \u2013 but it\u2019s still important to practice the 3 W\u2019s.\nThe current 3 authorized vaccines are very effective against severe COVID-19. Similar to the flu shot, it is not 100% effective against all COVID-19, and you still might have mild disease. Since the majority of adults are not yet vaccinated, it is important to continue to adhere to the 3 W\u2019s especially in the workplace, public and among those who are unvaccinated or at high risk for severe disease.

Sometimes immunity is long-lasting and sometimes it\u2019s not. I read that for SARS (the original one) and MERS, antibody response was short lived although there was a longer lasting T cell response.\nThe coronavirus vaccines, with the exception of killed/inactivated vaccines, introduces just the spike protein (as mRNA or DNA) into us so that we get an immune response against this non-self molecule and generate memory. This results in a rapid response if we encounter the spike protein again when infected by the virus.\nThe spike protein is getting mutated (the Brazilian, UK or South African variants) but if the epitope that our antibodies or TCR recognizes is unchanged the vaccine-elicited immunity will continue to work. If, say our neutralizing abs do not bing the spike due to mutations in the spike, the vaccine will not work. In theory, the inactive virus vaccine gives our immune system a lot more targets than just the spike.

I can\u2019t say for certain that vaccines using a different mechanism of action will be just as durable an immune response, but I don\u2019t see why not. The mechanism of action is different, but the intended response is to induce cells to create mRNA from the cell nucleus, which is then copied by RdRp and the resulting mRNA is read by ribosomes within the cell, in order produce the same/similar spike proteins that are produced by mRNA introduced into cells used by mRNA vaccines.\n\nI\u2019m not enough of an expert to answer answers, for instance why the efficacy of these other vaccines are different, but as far as resulting immunity, the innate arm should have the memory to stimulate the adaptive arm response in order to fight off the virus.

The health department or entity that gave you your vaccines should have a record of it. Also, for those who had insurance, they should have a record of it. For people without insurance, I would assume they would at least take down whatever identification you provide them for record keeping. These can be compiled into a central database and that could be possibly queried by organizations that need to know whether you\u2019ve had the vaccine. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m assuming at this point. I don\u2019t know what actual information is required for a vaccination to be administered, I just know that for myself, they took down my insurance info. I\u2019m in the United States(specifically North Carolina.) I know that even in the 80\u2019s/90\u2019s when I was in elementary school, proof of certain vaccinations were required.

Similarly, for certain countries that require yellow fever/other vaccines, there are proof requirements that are likely going to be similarly required. I can\u2019t say 100% for certain, because each area has different record-keeping, but records are kept generally. \n\nI think with technology, there will be some way to authenticate vaccinations, without disclosing other health information.

All this vaccine does is give the body information about the virus. The virus hijacks the RNA cells, infects them, and makes them multiply.

This stops the virus from multiplying and making the person sick. \n\nOn the questionnaire they have you fill out, it asks if you have a blood disorder. Pick yes and they will ask you what it is.

YouTube is where research goes to be diluted for  dissemination, and once there it devolves from misinterpretation and hyperbole into rumor, myth, and urban legend. We see the same thing happening on Reddit threads, to a lesser degree bc of the literacy requirement. ;)\n\nThe assumption that information on YouTube is true without checking the source(s) stems from \u201calgorithmic bias conditioning,\u201d IE assuming the top Google hit is \u201cbest\u201d and therefore true, many many times until its automatic, EG Google sorts for popularity, not veracity. It makes people even more vulnerable to confirmation bias, because the algorithm just shows more of what you\u2019ve been watching. The algorithm is designed to maximize screen time, not find truth, and rabbit holes are the best way to keep someone engaged. Just learned about that Algorithm bias stuff. It\u2019s pretty fascinating but also scary AF, because our impulse to hit the share button may unwittingly turn us into WiFi boosters for unverified information. \n\n*My advice to anyone reading this would be to disregard YouTube in its entirety when it comes to health and pandemic information.* Anything worth watching on there has an original, more reliable source, often without the fevered interpretation. To me it honestly feels like I\u2019m just choosing to ignore rabbit holes, that one no different from the dozens I\u2019ve seen, and probably over a hundred I\u2019ve ignored.

If China praised mRNA 'vaccine' from Pfizer and Moderna then you have to think twice.  Napoleon once said, \"Don't tell the enemy they are making a mistake.\"  Also I read some Chinese literature, you praise your enemy when they are making a mistake so that they make more mistake.\n\n1. mRNA injection into a slow-grow virus is supposed to produce the same Covid receptor.  I like that idea.  If the virus continues the slow growth then you can reduce the dose.  I don't like the whole bottle injected into me.  When the actual virus invades me, they came in very small dose, then growth.\n2. I like the good old method of using dead virus to inject into the body, provoke the response.  I prefer J&amp;J type vaccine that would inject in my body in small amount.  I am willing to make multiple trips.  Can I ask a fair question?  Is there anything wrong with my wish?\n3. Also, I prefer a weak vaccine.  I practice a little martial arts and this dawns on me with the same philosophy.  When some one strikes you, don't try to block.  You would block nothing.  Instead, try to 'receive' it.  Receive here means you block a little bit, you glance the strike a little bit, and you absorb a little bit.  Then strike back.  Admit that you are not good enough to block, take some damage, and strike back to win.\n4. I would prefer to get vaccinated a little bit only, so that when the real thing, and any variant comes to me, my body will be ready to fight back.  I don't want to get over protected, over-dosed.  In fact, I prefer everyone else get vaccinated, then I don't have to get vaccinated.  The side effect is not good for me.\n5. I already got attacked by some mysterious flu so I am very strong now.

OP, I encourage you to do research on what actually causes birth defects or at least the ones you are worried about. Use information that is based on peer-reviewed literature, or talk to a doctor. Reddit is good for personal opinions - but opinions are subjective and personal, and sometimes can draw false conclusions (including my comment here lol). A good start may be to look for *peer reviewed research* about your topic of concern and *email the researchers themselves*. They can explain better than any of us.\n\nThis is just from my quick searches: You\u2019ll find many birth defects are genetic, which again, will not be affected by the vaccine because the vaccine works based on RNA strands that create proteins - not DNA. In fact, DNA can\u2019t be altered - the DNA your child will inherit is already in you and has been since the day you were born. \n\nThere are some defects that are caused by the environment, and as research shows you\u2019d need to be exposed to a very large amount of heavy metals (lead, mercury, etc.) for that to happen - none of which are present in the vaccine. [Here is a medical resource explaining what is in the vaccines](https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2021/01/11/a-simple-breakdown-of-the-ingredients-in-the-covid-vaccines/) \n\nFor illnesses, you may also want to read [this](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/features/kf-maternal-cold-birth-defects-during-pregnancy.html) from the CDC. Pregnant people that get a cold or flu with a fever have an increased risk of having a baby with a defect. Playing devil\u2019s advocate here, since COVID-19 also produces fever and flu-like symptoms (and sometimes worse), couldn\u2019t contracting COVID or severe form of it (assuming you didn\u2019t get the vaccine) create a risk for a birth defect?\n\nBirth defects are not uncommon. I understand that they are not desirable - but I want to emphasize that you could do everything perfectly but still end up with a child that has a defect. Some can be helped. Others cannot. Many still lead healthy, happy lives with them. \n\nIn the end, we can\u2019t decide anything for you.

The variants are slightly mutated but seem to so far use the same spike proteins, so there is little reason to believe the vaccines are not effective against them.\n\nThe other main reason is that the reason mutations exist is because the virus has been able to spread far and wide, maximising opportunity to mutate and change. If we cut down on the spread of the virus by vaccinating as many people as possible, we cut the virus's ability to mutate, and variants stop popping up as much or completely ideally", "Oh wow!

There are viruses that bats can get but humans cant because the spike proteins have no way of attaching to human cells, but if a virus mutates in such a way the spike proteins change then this can mean all of a sudden a virus is transmissible to humans, and this is likely how the outbreak first started, an existing bat virus mutated to be able to infect humans and here we are. Its also how we have \"swine\" or \"bird\" flu as these viruses have mutated to allow human transmission.\n\nIf all coronavirus variants so far use the same spike proteins then a vaccine that works by making your body recognise the spike proteins should work against all variants.\n\nThis is also why wealthy nations should supply poorer nations with vaccines as soon as possible, while some people believe \"protect your own first\" if the virus is running rampant in other parts of the world it can cause new variants to form quicker and more often. Vaccinating people in other countries does, indirectly, protect your own population.", "1. Well, the vaccine has 95% efficacy, so it shouldn't work in 1 person out of 20.\n2. As you said, none of the trials involved intentional exposure to covid (that would be unethical), so someone with the placebo could have just been careful to avoid infection, exactly like any other person that still hasn't got neither the shot nor covid.\n3. The idea of an experiment with control group is that, assuming both groups represents a slice of \"average humans\", without the vaccine the humans in one group should have the same probability of being infected of the humans in the other group, so if the group with the vaccine has been infected a lot less than the other group the vaccine must have had an effect.

Remember that the adverse effects on VAERS and YELLOW CARD are considerably underreported.\n\n2) a) It does. I'm asking you what you think it means that 28 people can get a Covid positive after taking the vaccine whether they are false positives or not? Either the vaccines lower the immune system and let any opportunistic virus/pathogen in or something in those vaccines was giving them a positive PCR. The other two positives in the group were for influenza I think which is more baffling.\n\nb) It's a he and he is in charge of many more Covid cases than just one elderly home.

These elderly in a home hardly came into contact with anyone in a secure at risk centre where everyone is suited and booted to not get Covid. He did mention that detail.\n\nI have seen this happen in news reports before in Spanish nursing homes where entire care homes came out Covid positive after being vaccinated where none were before. In one of those cases 10 of those people in a care residence died after the vaccination. In the case that my friend told me about, no one died curiously. It showed me that this is obviously happening more than we know but is being covered up. Well there are quite a few cases popping up about post-Covid positive PCR's now but it's mostly individuals.\n\nWith that story I am merely asking you what is going on when that can happen? You can disregard it if you like.

I mean 'they' are forever talking about the need to reduce the world's population using the fake man made climate change narrative so why wouldn't the psychopaths in charge, who are happy to go to war under false pretences, follow through on their words?\n\nWhat you're missing is that there is already a steady clandestine depopulation campaign going on. The same people who are responsible for Covid itself, lockdowns (lockups!) and the dangerous vaccines are also responsible for poisoning the human populace via water, GM foods, the air (chemtrails dropping dangerous heavy metals and chemicals from planes under the pretext of geo-engineering), vaccines, iatrogenic deaths, household toiletries even. The rate of disease is unnaturally crazy and although you might dismiss it as irresponsible corporations and equally as irresponsible people, there are verifiable links that tie it all together and point to the psychopaths in charge and their lower tier minions being the perpetrators. \n\nRegarding the deaths from the vaccine, perhaps you've heard of VAERS and the YELLOW CARD SCHEME in the UK where people record adverse affects and deaths from vaccines? Vernon Coleman, a man who has been fighting corruption and injustice his whole adult life, has done us the favour of collating different links to track the current death tolls.

You see, they added thousands of deaths that weren't Covid related and that were registered positive on the inefficient PCR tests which do not differentiate active from inactive infections. People getting a positive Covid test within 28 days of death, even if they died from car crash injuries, were put down as dying of Covid.  According to the CDC only 6% died of only Covid. Many deaths occurred in hospitals because available effective treatments like Ivermectin and Chloroquine were suppressed and hidden and instead patients were place on ventilators which they knew would kill them. Hospitals were actually paid for Covid deaths and putting people on ventilators. Incentivized deaths! Many people died because they were too scared to get treatment thanks to media scaremongering. Everything was preventable and there never should have been a pandemic announcement.\n\nhttps://brandnewtube.com/watch/final-irrefutable-proof-that-the-covid-19-pandemic-never-existed_JmPw8cUxQG1w7NP.html\n\nRegarding the goal of their coming new stage of the system.

They intend to bring in a cashless society and digital fascism where our Chinese-style social credit scores are linked to our universal income digital payouts. We do something the establishment don't want, our money gets cut off. It's so simple. Look up the Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum and their 'Great Reset' strategy which many countries have signed on for.

But if that was today, assholes like you would scream and belittle us for listening to the other doctors and making our own decisions instead of just believing what your master tells you.\n\nThat's why packaging on EVERYTHING said \"fat free\" and I laugh cause I still see this pointless corporate statement still on some products today!\n\nThink of the MILLIONS that suffered, died, diseased, broken, changed lives forever just because of this one evil lie so corporations can make $$$$ off these people at the expense of their lives.....\n\nIt's why people like you make me sick. Hey if you want to believe in Santa Claus, every person comes from Adam and Eve and all women came from a spare rib, and big pharma has your best interest in your health.......then go do that!

I'm very sorry for the loss of your grandmother. \n\nUnfortunately it is clear to me that although she may have had Covid, she didn't die because of Covid, she died because the psychopaths who are running the Covid operation suppressed and defamed effective treatments like Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine and Dexamethasone which 'they' know work well against the laboratory modified pathogen they released last year. They made sure these medicines were declared useless because if they weren't, they would not have been able to announce a pandemic, lock up much of the world and bring in their pre-planned vaccine cull. The people who dared to go to hospital with breathing difficulties from Covid were put into an induced coma and on ventilators which they soon found out killed people. This wasn't necessary as CPAP or corticosteroids could have been utlized. They are still using ventilators and they are still killing people that way. In the US and I'm sure other countries, hospitals are being paid for Covid deaths and putting people on ventilators. Incentivized deaths! That should tell the world everything in that detail.\n\nAdditionally, they have identified that lack of vitamin D has contributed greatly to whether or not someone was infected with Covid but you don't see them mentioning the necessity of that. Any government concerned with actual health would have closed fast food, alcohol and cigarette outlets and would have distributed essential vitamins like D, C and Zinc to the at risk groups. They did the opposite. Instead of prescribing fresh air and sunlight they locked people up in their houses so they had no chance of getting vitamin D and moreover deprived them of their normal air supply by mandating masks that don't stop viruses and trap harmful bacteria that we are supposed to expel. Ridiculous.\n\nSo the vaccines aren't vaccines, it's unproven dangerous cell-hacking, gene transfer technology in a needle. I think they are dangerous because:\n\na. Vaccine companies like Pfizer are literally criminal felons who have killed millions and simply paid fines to be permitted to continue their ongoing massacre. They are not responsible or liable for injuries or deaths caused by their vaccines.\n\nb. The world is run by psychopathic oligarchs and any big event that appears in their paid for, controlled media falls under their umbrella. People following the chess moves of these people recognized their modus operandi immediately. This virus scenario has been expected by researchers for over a decade as the big boys have been running simulations and talking about it's coming as a certainty for years. They have also been predictively programming a global killer virus scenario through Hollywood, a propaganda arm of governments and oligarchs to prepare us for this moment.\n\nc. Good people with expertise and without financial motives have come out to tell us what these 'vaccines' really are capable of. Sherri Tenpenny (shunned and defamed by the mainstream) has done thousands of hours of research into these vaccines and has found over a dozen ways they potentially can destroy the recipients from within. That is happening now. Example of such an experts warning of the truth:\n\n[https://brandnewtube.com/watch/rna-expert-dr-henrion-caude-calls-out-vaccines-as-madness-mass-gene-therapy-experiment\\_jnIqFqVJslR8TWM.html](https://brandnewtube.com/watch/rna-expert-dr-henrion-caude-calls-out-vaccines-as-madness-mass-gene-therapy-experiment_jnIqFqVJslR8TWM.html)\n\n[https://brandnewtube.com/watch/harvard-trained-md-warns-of-the-vaccine\\_oTqY2RrDK1iTEJx.html](https://brandnewtube.com/watch/harvard-trained-md-warns-of-the-vaccine_oTqY2RrDK1iTEJx.html)\n\nSherri Tenpenny.

They announced that the AstraZeneca and J &amp; J vaccines were utterly safe. They weren't. They stopped them for blood clot concerns. This was a magicians trick to distract attention away from the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA 'vaccines' that were actually important to them in the future of genetic bio-modification which are surreptitiously killing thousands and injuring hundreds of thousands even though they too were supposed to be completely safe. It is not wise to believe the words of consummate and inveterate liars caught in their deceit over and over. \n\ne. Thousands of people are registered as dying from these vaccines and hundreds of thousands are registering adverse effects.\n\nRegarding the Covid death numbers, they are hugely inflated. The ruling elite did everything they could to have as many deaths registered as being from Covid as possible as well as using a test, the PCR, which gave a huge number of false positives. You could die from car crash injuries and if tested positive on the PCR, be a Covid death. Funny how anybody dying within 28 days of having Covid was a Covid death but literally no one dying after 15 mins of having a vaccine is considered a vaccine death. That's the power of vaccine companies and the oligarchs' media empire. There were many other deaths that were falsely labelled as being caused by Covid. The medical negligence and malpractice deaths were huge. The CDC admitted that only 6% of their total number of deaths were of only Covid. I can't fathom how many people dying of cancer and other fatal diseases were unceremoniously lumped into the Covid bracket. They needed the death numbers to seem high because that's the way they can scare people into continuing the overall fraud. \n\nThis is one news outlet that reported it at the time:\n\n[https://brandnewtube.com/watch/cdc-reveals-hospitals-counted-heart-attacks-as-covid19-deaths\\_6N6CYt3LxALi6OF.html](https://brandnewtube.com/watch/cdc-reveals-hospitals-counted-heart-attacks-as-covid19-deaths_6N6CYt3LxALi6OF.html)\n\nThe full hospitals narrative was a lie. Hospitals were no more full than any other year if not more empty. Many doctors and nurses were sent home because the authorities stopped caring so much about all other diseases. Imagine how many people did not get treatments and died or had undiagnosed illnesses and couldn't get them checked out? This was all planned to happen and the lockdowns have been the cause of so much more damage and despair than Covid itself. It's all perception and despicable psychological warfare on the public.\n\nTo summarize: Covid was a real pathogen that people unnecessarily died from that was released by the shadow players who practically own and run the planet. They released it to cause enough damage so as to be able to scare people into submitting to their nonsensical draconian lockdowns and injunctions. This stage also killed many. The next stage included the half pretence that the public were clamoring for a solution to which the government were happy to announce several vaccines in preparation. These were actually all ready to go long before Covid was announced as was the plan to distribute them, but to get these dangerous concoctions out under the radar, they had to pretend that animal tests couldn't be done in time and that they would have to rush them out under emergency status. That was all lies. Previous animal tests proved deadly which is why they had to be avoided. They know how much destruction they will cause in the short, middle and long term but they needed a killer virus narrative to make the situation appear serious enough for the public to accept these depopulation shots.\n\nI've written a lot and not very eloquently.

Johnson and Johnson had to pay out over 100 million dollars, because their baby powders contained asbestos in them (cancer causing substance) - which they knew about. \n\nJust in the UK, the countries health secretary, pushing for everybody to take the vaccine has shares in topwood with his sister. This company has business with the national health service (NHS). He literally profits from getting people to take the vaccine...conflict of interest or what?\n\nCheck out Thalydimide, check out Pandemrix - medicine and a vaccine that governments pushed and ended up years and years later with people suffering long lasting and damaging side effects that had never been predicted, but unlucky people had to experience. \n\nVaccine manufacturers have blanket immunity should anybody suffer lasting or fatal side effects from the vaccine. \n\nHow long does efficacy last? Scientists do not know about that either, and suggest we all need to get booster shots every six months. There is too much uncertainty from people who are meant to be experts and know everything about the safety of this.\n\nPCR tests are garbage, and provide many false negatives and false positives. The swabs used in the tests also contain a substance that is cancer causing. Figures have been warped and modified to suit governments agendas. Any death where somebody was positive for covid, but died from something completely unrelated was put down as covid deaths. Whenever somebody dies days, or even hours after the vaccine however, government and scientists are extremely hesitant to list the vaccine as the cause, despite the person being in good health before with nothing wrong with them.\n\nAnd of course you have the shaming. If you have legitimate concerns over the vaccine, or you are leaning on the fence, instant bullying tactics, guilt tripping, shaming language, censoring and even cancelling, since people have lost jobs over having a different opinion over the vaccine and speaking it.

The latest myth is that mRNA vaccines may trigger prion diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\n&gt;Like the universe, the internet appears to be governed by a set of (admittedly tongue-in-cheek) \"laws.\" The most famous is\u00a0Godwin's Law, which posits that \"as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.\"\n\n&gt;There are plenty of others. The coronavirus pandemic has put on grand display a lesser-known but far more important \"law\" known as\u00a0Brandolini's Law, which claims that the \"amount of energy needed to refute bullsh** is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it.\"\n\n&gt;This, of course, is absolutely true. The reason is that people who spread lies are, by definition, not constrained by the truth. Making stuff up takes little effort while doing the diligent research necessary to arrive at the truth takes tremendous effort. That's why, as the adage goes, a lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth gets its shoes on.\n\n&gt;The COVID pandemic has made this painfully clear. Among the most\u00a0pernicious myths\u00a0is one that claims the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are a form of genetic engineering, a lie that is being perpetuated by none other than\u00a0fraud doctor Andrew Wakefield.\n\n&gt;Now, a new myth has reared its ugly head. A\u00a0paper\u00a0written by a well-known\u00a0anti-vaxxer named J. Bart Classen\u00a0and published in a scientific journal -- if we can even call it that (because it's not indexed in PubMed) -- claims that the mRNA vaccines that target coronavirus could cause prion diseases like Alzheimer's. It's total garbage.\n\n&gt;A Primer on Prions\nIn order for proteins to work, they must be folded properly. An unfolded protein is useless. By analogy, think of origami. An unfolded protein is like a piece of paper, and a folded protein is like an\u00a0origami crane. A misfolded protein is also no good; it would be like breaking the crane's neck or wing. Again, useless.\n\n&gt;Sometimes, misfolded proteins are dangerous. A particularly dangerous one is known as a prion. When it misfolds, it causes other properly folded proteins to misfold. Imagine if the origami crane with a broken wing caused all of its origami crane friends to develop broken wings. That's what prions do. The most famous prion disease is Mad Cow Disease, the infectious form of a rare neurodegenerative condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\nIncreasingly, evidence indicates that other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's are caused by misfolded proteins that trigger misfolding in other proteins. In the case of Alzheimer's, the proteins are called beta-amyloid\u00a0and tau.\n\n&gt;No, COVID mRNA Vaccine Won't Cause Alzheimer's\nSo, what does this have to do with COVID mRNA vaccines? Absolutely nothing. But that didn't prevent Classen from speculating that these mRNA vaccines might trigger the misfolding of two other proteins (called TDP-43 and FUS) that are also associated with Alzheimer's (as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).\n\n&gt;His evidence is non-existent. In the methods section of the paper, Classen writes, \"The vaccine RNA was analyzed for the presence of sequences that can activate TDP-43 and FUS.\" How was it analyzed? What software was used? Did he examine any controls, like cellular mRNA sequences? He doesn't say. He simply tells us that the COVID vaccines contain various RNA sequences that may trigger TDP-43 and FUS's misfolding.\nThat's it. It's entirely speculative. There's no actual evidence.\n\n&gt;Yet, from that, he concludes that the vaccine may be worse than the disease. For good measure, he mentions that the coronavirus and the mRNA vaccines both might be bioweapons released by the U.S. government. Hopefully, he notified Fox Mulder.\nOne would think that this conspiracy is too kooky to go viral (no pun intended). But we've already seen people burning 5G towers because they think they spread the coronavirus. So, it's better to debunk it now before the Andrew Wakefields of the world get ahold of it.", "It's a B.S. website citing a B.S. vanity journal. See my other comments for the debunk.", "Thanks!!", "Reading through the references from the paper and looking up stuff I don't know on Wikipedia, I basically found out that the 'prions' he is discussing can also be caused by cellular stress.

The docs don't really know what side effect to the fetus and Covid, as well as Covid shot.\n\nThe side effect can be very potent.  My foster parents and many parents asked me when I was a teen, \"How come you are so smart?\"\n\nI honestly replied, \"Being poor makes you work harder, perhaps being poor also makes me smart.  Things are much simple.  Poor folks only think about the next meal and a place to sleep at night.\"\n\nBut the vicious street fight also made me smart.

I will fight, if I have a chance to win.\" \n\nI myself don't like the vaccine as it is now.  I am delaying my decision to understand better.

Vaccine types:\n\n1. Conventional dead, inactive Covid virus.  Quick to serve the people in need.  Exact anti-body to match with would be virus.\n2. Vector virus, supposed to more effective, allow 1-shot to save time for those don't want many shots, for those who think they are indestructible.\n3. mRNA virus induced, less effective as Vector virus but still have an advantage of a living slow growing virus.  Growing virus will mimic the incubation period.  The last two methods are the gene therapy in a way.\n4. Vaccines must be offered at 1, 2, or more than 2 shots.  The more than 2 shots are for those who don't mind to take more shots to be safe, to avoid over-dose.\n\nB. Dealing with the medical companies:\n\n1. Respect capitalism.  Let companies freely bid which type of vaccine they would produce.  Give incentive to the type not be covered.  Make them bid for the right to produce a certain type. \n2. Use the power if the state to make sure each of the 4 types to be covered.\n\nC. Vaccination plan, manage by objective, MBO:\n\n1. The most important goal, and for all people is to prevent dead, not to induce vaccine death.  Vaccine everyone with at least one shot.  Give people the choice path 1, 2, or more that 2 shots.\n2. Prevent damage.  If you are vaccinated, you can always get sick by the actual virus.  Virus always infect anyone, vaccinate or not vaccinated.  Virus can be quickly defeated and the damaged can be reduced.  (This year, 2021 I actually defeated a mysterious flu within 2-3 day, but my recovery has been long.  Much damage has happened.)\n3. Prevent spreading.  For the people whose jobs required them to expose to a lot of people, give them move shoots.  Boost the shots and/or switch type of vaccine.\n\nRemember this, if you want to save life, more life can be save.  If you want to save time, you are increasing risk to die.

I let nature takes its course until my hair grew so long and my barber neigbor kept refusing vaccine.  I then realized she got a point.  I want the government to stop pointing fingers at the J&amp;J problem.  Can they get the story straight?\n\nI do have a simple common sense question:  Given that we have millions of unused vaccines can we use them at half the dose but twice the number of shots?

After the adjuvant dose, multiple things could occur. First, humans CAN develop immunity to adenovirus-vectored vaccines. The reason that AstraZeneca chose the virus that they did, was specifically for the lack of pre-existing immunity to it, and even though it is cross-reactive in that humans can develop immunity to that specific adenovirus.\n\nI specifically don\u2019t know exactly how the body immunologically deals with the ChAdOx1 adenovirus, but they picked that adenovirus specifically, at least in part due to low pre-existing seroprevalence against it. And although it is a cross-species virus, the human immune system can become immune to it.\n\nThat being said, whilst I as a lay person with some medical training, and in particular I was going to college for a doctorate of Pharmacy(PharmD), I did something I regret and changed majors, only to fall short of 2-quarters(20wks of classes &amp; 2wks of exams, equivalent to approx 15-20 credits on the semester system) from a dual bachelors of science in computer/software engineering. I know you didn\u2019t ask for my personal background, so, I have several medical issues personally and am somewhat of an autodidact when it comes to medical literature. \n\nThe thing about the AstraZeneca vaccine, adenovirus vaccines CAN(potentially, not definite)have a nasty array of effects if they are encountered a lot. You will at the very least likely get a similar cytokine/inflammatory reaction to it. The vaccine itself is good at inducing Cytotoxic T-Cell memory. Assuming a lack of immune response to the adenovirus itself, the virus itself is non-replicating. It gets in, causes the cells to produce spike proteins, until the cell can no longer do it. There are a finite number of viruses to infect a limited number of cells. \n\nAnywho, in this short of a time-frame, the innate arm of your immune system has learned to remember and activate other parts of the immune system. In fact, you may well still have circulating neutralizing antibodies from the second vaccine dose. I can see no positives to taking three jabs in 4 months, and it may well be dangerous. If you asked me, I\u2019d say it was unwise. I\u2019d ask someone with a deeper understanding of the mechanism\u2019s of adenovirus-vectored vaccines.\n\nWhat people don\u2019t fully understand about adv-vectored vaccines, is they have only been used mostly in small scale studies and experimentally in the past. To say J&amp;J is using old vaccine technology, while Pfizer is using new technology, well that\u2019s not a fully accurate statement. While virus-vectored vaccines have been studied for many years, it\u2019s never been used on this scale. MRNA is newer but the mechanism is pretty straightforward.

He held adjunct faculty appointments at universities in Belgium and Germany. After his career in Academia, Geert joined several vaccine companies (GSK Biologicals, Novartis Vaccines, Solvay Biologicals) to serve various roles in vaccine R&amp;D as well as in late vaccine development. Geert then moved on to join the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Global Health Discovery team in Seattle (USA) as Senior Program Officer; he then worked with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) in Geneva as Senior Ebola Program Manager. At GAVI he tracked efforts to develop an Ebola vaccine. He also represented GAVI in fora with other partners, including WHO, to review progress on the fight against Ebola and to build plans for global pandemic preparedness. Back in 2015, Geert scrutinized and questioned the safety of the Ebola vaccine that was used in ring vaccination trials conducted by WHO in Guinea.", "Yes he's trying to develop his own vaccine and it is in his interests to badmouth his competitors.", "So anyone who are against mass vaccination with an untested \"vaccine\" is just a badmouther, dealing with anger or a conspicary theorist? Seriously mate, Have you considered that you are viewing science as a religion?\n\nOkay, since you shot down all arguments with poor responses that dont really convince me of taking the vaccine, What about States like Florida? Where are all the cases? all the the deaths? The country havent had any serious restrictions for over half a year.. ? How do you explain cases like that?", "There have been a lot of vaccinations in Florida.  I have not defended all the lockdowns, many of which I considered ill-advised.  But you are changing the subject again .  The issue is the value of vaccinations.  If you are looking for a place that downplayed vaccinations till recently look at India.  India had vaccinated a negligible proprtion of its population but was sending hydroxychloroquine out like water.  So when push came to shove hcq didnt work, Idia's hospitals are deluged with sick covid patients, and they are desperately trying to play catchup with vaccination.  India is the prime example of what the world would look like if it had followed antivaxxer rhetoric.", "Interesting that when one probes a bit, most of the prominent antivaxxers have solid financial reasons to oppose the current vaccines.", "I would agree with you on that. And for that reason I always keep my mind open..  But would you say that government has never been bribed by big corporations or big pharma before? Why is it that Big Pharmaceutical industries have billions of dollars in law suits on their necks or bribing and illegal mangement of the works they do? These very industries are the ones responsible for making your vaccines.. Not to say that they arent even held accountable for the damage their vaccines could do.. Its literally screaming to the skies with conspiracy..", "No, Im not changing the subject... The mainstream narative is that vaccines is the only or the main way out of this .. And when you look at states like Florida that just deosnt hold up.. No way near are they having \"Herd immunity\" and YET, they should be overrun with cases because of laxed lockdowns, and yet its not the case.. So the whole lockdown and herd immunity through vaccines falls to the ground pretty hard.   \n\n\nAre you saying that HCQ worked well in India? or Maybe the cases started rising because they started mass vaccination? And to add to it.. Arent there more cases in Germany then India for each 100.000 people?", "Vaccines are the main way out of it.  No they dont have herd immunity but things are improved due to vaccination.  No Im saying hcq did not work well in India.  If HCQ worked so well why are Indian hospitals ctowded with sick patients with shortages of oxygen snd respiratots.  On the other hand look at Israel where thanks to vaccination new cases have gone from 10k a day to less than 100, masks are no longer required outdoors and social events are almost completely permitted.  Antivaxxers are having less and less wighle room to spread their poison.  Perhaps its time to start inventing excuses for your conduct. \"I was just following orders\".  \"I was on the moon during the entire pandemic\", \"My dog ate my mask.\"", "Keeps them honest.  Corruption is possible anywhere.  But tell me why the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated while the billion dollar nutritional supplement industry is barely regulated at all.

There are treatments that work for covid (Ivermectin, Chloroquine) that are safe and effective. The only reason we're not using them is there aren't massive profits with those drugs.", "VAERS has little relation to vaccination except temporal .  It is just a raw database which mostly picks up baseline noise with no causative relation whatsoever to prior vaccination.  VAERS can serve as a source for a clustering effect of side effects which might indicate a relationship, but taking VAERS on its own is the hallmark of one clueless in basic statistics.

They are about to get full approval in a month or so.  The FDA is also about to extend the age range from 12 to 15.

There's a ton of speculation on why people react to one vs the other (one popular theory is that its your second exposure to COVID, so if you previously had it, even if you were asymptomatic, you'll have a reaction to the first shot), not the second. \n\nThere are theories about why some people have more severe reactions then others (the reaction to the vaccine signals how intense your symptoms to COVID would have been). \n\nThere has been a LOT of anecdotal stories about people's reactions, but a search of VAERS ([https://vaers.hhs.gov/](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)) will show you they're purely anecdotal... the incidence of serious reactions like Bell's are almost unheard of, and of the serious reactions, barring the J and J blood clot, they've found no causation between the vaccine and the side effect. \n\nYour physician can help you understand how many antibodies your body formed, which requires a blood test.

Just the same, understand that the reason people are asking is because ultimately they are concerned about you and care about you and the community.   \nSo, Dr. Bhakdi's claims have been debunked in many publications.

Your risk profile from COVID is in almost any mathematical scenario, much greater. And that's only when you take into account the effects on one's self. When you take into account the community effects, that risk ratio is even more out of balance. \n\nNot every shot puts you at risk of blood clots... there is a limited risk with the J and J vaccine. But every exposure to COVID puts you at risk of severe symptoms that.. while we can predict the severity of to some degree based on underlying health, still manages to take down completely healthy people with devastating effects in numbers far far greater than reported vaccine side effects. \n\nWhile there are now treatments,as one poster suggests.. remember that people are still dying, every single day of COVID in our country. While treatments have steadily gotten better, they are not a panacea (neither is the vaccine, but statistically its much closer). Also, again, we're still talking about personal vs community risk. Because the longer we have people unvaccinated, the more risk there is for variants, and those variants may not respond to the vaccine OR the new treatments. (I mean, maybe they'll respond better! but that's not generally the trend we're seeing, just playing both sides of the fence here). \n\nI guess the best question is this: regardless of the paper receipts... why do you NOT want to get it, if you're ok sharing.

We know more about the vaccine than COVID-19. \n\nYou are indeed, in a lower risk group and that's great. Keep your health up and you lower your risk. That said, we are seeing rising numbers of young people, healthy young people, with severe symptoms and infection rates. Its something you should keep an eye on.

Everyone has heard about a bad case, but in actuality, there's very little of that in VAERS (the place all the side effects are reporter). \n\nSecond, we rarely hear about people with NO side effects, which is lots of people. We convinced people that side effects were proof the vaccines were working (they are, but lack of side effects is not a sign they're not working).

I'm not saying people aren't feeling the effects and I would absolutely expert there's an arc and some people feel extreme effects the same way some people feel nothing. But for instance, an entire restaurant reported side effects 4-5 days after the first Pfizer dose, and that is not about the vaccine. That is just mass hysteria. The whole \"I was laid out all day!\" narrative is something I think people just roll with to participate in vaccine euphoria. \n\nI don't rule out that there might be classes of side effects seen in grosser groups later.

Even mild cases are finding long term inexplicable effects sometimes).

These stimuli open its central pore, allowing electrical current to flow through the cell membrane; this evokes nervous impulses that travel into the spinal cord and then up to the brain.\nGuler and his colleagues reasoned that magnetic torque (or rotating) forces might activate TRPV4 by tugging open its central pore, and so they used genetic engineering to fuse the protein to the paramagnetic region of ferritin, together with short DNA sequences that signal cells to transport proteins to the nerve cell membrane and insert them into it.\nWhen they introduced this genetic construct into human embryonic kidney cells growing in Petri dishes, the cells synthesized the 'Magneto' protein and inserted it into their membrane. Application of a magnetic field activated the engineered TRPV1 protein, as evidenced by transient increases in calcium ion concentration within the cells, which were detected with a fluorescence microscope.\nNext, the researchers inserted the Magneto DNA sequence into the genome of a virus, together with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein, and regulatory DNA sequences that cause the construct to be expressed only in specified types of neurons. They then injected the virus into the brains of mice, targeting the entorhinal cortex, and dissected the animals' brains to identify the cells that emitted green fluorescence.

The problem with the first few papers of your list (I only had time to read 3) are that they used the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database as a sole source. \n\nFrom Parker et al. \"VAERS is a passive reporting system that is monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA and to which anyone\u2014health care provider, vaccinee, or parent\u2014may report an AE after vaccination.44 Although the authors postulated complete reporting of AEs by stating that \u201call adverse reactions are to be reported to the VAERS database as required by US law,\u201d in fact, reporting is mandated only for events included in the \u201cinjury table\u201d of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program; ASDs and NDDs potentially associated with diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis (DTP)/DTaP or thimerosal exposure are not mandated. Moreover, for these and other adverse reactions, substantial underreporting occurs.44\u201346 Underreporting is particularly common for events that are not in the compensation program, for events that are not defined by a specific diagnostic test, or when the temporal relationship with vaccination is not well defined, both of which apply to the conditions evaluated in this study.\"\n\nThe issue is that using low quality epidemiology data can lead to spurious conclusions. From Parker et al. \"Demonstrating the statistical fragility of analysis of this database, if only 1 child who has autism and did not receive thimerosal-containing DTaP were misclassified into the thimerosal group or if 1 such child were not reported to the VAERS system, then the reported risk ratio would be reduced by half and the P value would be &gt;.05.\"\n\nI would also pose you a question: If thiomersal causes autism why has the AD/ASD rate not dropped sharply since it was removed from childhood vaccines around 2000? \n\nFinally, if you want to see the harm this sort of misinformation causes please read about the 83 deaths from the 2019 measles outbreak in Samoa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\\_Samoa\\_measles\\_outbreak)", "VAERS is literally the only way to report it. You can\u2019t sue for vaccine injuries so how else would someone report it? No one is paying for studies to prove otherwise and if they do they get redacted and the researchers and/or Dr\u2019s ostracized. Normally there would be a class action lawsuit, discovery, restitution etc. but a 1986 bill waived all liability.\n\nMercury has been replaced by aluminum. Look up how many mgs they give a baby in a hep b vaccine at 12 hours old. There are plenty of studies on aluminum toxicity.", "Please read the Madsen paper. It has solid data. \n\nRegarding aluminium it is normally added as an adjuvant for vaccines, thiomersal was added as a preservative (they are different).  Can you show data on toxicity against the Hep B vaccine?\n\nFrom my reading there is 0.5mg of AlOH in the HepB vaccine (in a 1mL vial). To put that into perspective (from https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum):\n\n\"The aluminum contained in vaccines is similar to that found in a liter (about 1 quart or 32 fluid ounces) of infant formula. While infants receive about 4.4 milligrams\\* of aluminum in the first six months of life from vaccines, they receive more than that in their diet. Breast-fed infants ingest about 7 milligrams, formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams, and infants who are fed soy formula ingest almost 117 milligrams of aluminum during the first six months of life.\"\n\nSo it is 1/14th the amount of aluminium a breast-milk fed child will be exposed to at the age of 6 months.", "Read the scientific journals that are currently being written/have yet to be written?

If you look at the Madsen paper you can see the effect of good input data. I agree that in the US the reporting system is poor (as are many aspects of the US healthcare system, but that is another discussion). The issue at hand is data quality. With poor input data it is very hard to do accurate epidemiology. So I am not avoiding talking about VARS, just pointing out the Parker paper highlights the shortfalls of this system and the issues with drawing epidemiological conclusions based on it.\n\nNext aluminium: Absorption levels of aluminium for oral vs IM administration. If Al is absorbed orally this will depend on the pharmacokinetics of Al metablism. An IM dose will be handled the same way as an oral dose by the body with the difference being the rate of change of Al concentration in plasma (and some VOD effects). I think most is bound rapidly by transferrin and albumin so I suspect the normal iron homeostatis process will handle this (but I need to do more reading as I have not done a lot of reading on Al metabolism). The main biological differences for oral vs injected effects are for substances that are either highly toxic (the injection causes a plasma \"spike\" that quickly gets you into a toxic level) or for compounds that are poorly absorbed orally or are broken down inside the GI tract. As Al has low toxicity I suspect that these are not the case.\n\nI agree that injection of toxins is much more dangerous, take KCl for example, a small volume of concentrated KCl will stop your heart very quickly, but I have not seen convincing data that this is the case for AlOH.\n\nIf I could ask you a question: If there is such a causative link between vaccination and autism why is it not seen in large, systematic studies like Madsen?", "Sorry one point I forgot to mention is the Al level. Your paper is referring to premature neonates (with impaired renal function) and uremic patients.

If you are fit healthy and a good immune system why take the risk for possible future unknown consequences IMO.", "You can\u2019t convince or force a vaccine upon anyone. If you are vaccinated and you are protected... then stop worrying about others. Do what is right for you. There\u2019s also a difference between being anti-vaccine and just skeptical of this particular one. The Covid-19 virus is still fairly new to us, hasn\u2019t been around that long. To trust a vaccine that was produced in under a year, for a virus experts still didn\u2019t have all answers on... can you blame people for wanting to hold off a bit? Not to mention, it is still pending FDA approval as it goes through clinical trials under emergency authorization. I trust science but I also know science doesn\u2019t happen overnight. I know that vaccines go through years of clinical trials and they go through changes before they are considered safe to the public. \n\nThis emergency authorization that they\u2019re administering the vaccine using, may or may not turn into an FDA approval if the studies show too many adverse reactions. I\u2019m in the healthcare field and I work with healthcare data and I can tell you that adverse reactions are happening.  They\u2019re just not being reported to the states (I\u2019m in the US).  And if they were, it will get no media coverage. Patients are being admitted into the ER and getting treated for sepsis, blood clotting, heart issues, rashes, all within 1-2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine is administered. Some of these patients have no record of pre-existing diagnosis or conditions that could have triggered any of this - all points to the vaccine. And because there is so little vaccine knowledge, even across clinical experts, there are gaps in care in how to treat patients who have these reactions.  \n\nThis might be the unpopular opinion but I really feel as if society has lost their minds a bit. No one should ever force, guilt or pressure another person into a vaccine. It\u2019s a personal choice. If you\u2019re not comfortable being around a non-vaccinated person, that is also your personal choice. \n\nI personally don\u2019t agree with a vaccinated person wanting to stay away from non vaccinated people. Why get a vaccine that you don\u2019t even believe is effective? There\u2019s a lot of misinformation on this vaccine and all I can say is... don\u2019t hate on people who choose not to get it right now. Everyone has different bodies and could have a different reaction and there\u2019s no way to know for sure. Keep your distance if its what makes you feel comfortable. \n\nAlso.. I\u2019m in the process of being vaccinated so I\u2019m not against it. I just get where people are coming from and I\u2019ve seen data that is concerning.

I also understand why low risk, healthy people are hesitant. I think for non vaccinated people, it\u2019s important to still be respectful as restrictions and mandates are being lifted. But have to be more understanding with the vaccine that just because some people don\u2019t want to get it, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care about the lives that have been lost.", "As to your point about not passing it on, the chances of passing the virus onto someone if you are vaccinated are slim to none.

I can understand why you'd be concerned about your health if you've already got challenges. Heart issues are scary.   \nHave you looked at the heart risks like myocarditis from COVID? Have you talked to your cardiologist about it? Same for eyesight. Maybe its worth figuring out if the risks are more from the virus or the vaccine for these issues?   \nAlso, there's some good news that very few people will catch and spread COVID once they have the vaccine- because how contagious you are is affected by your viral load, and even if you get COVID while vaccinated, your viral load is dramatically lower. But there's growing evidence that it actually prevents infection altogether. This may help understand how the herd immunity goal is rationalized. What do you think?   \nI think you have a really good point about flu shots, and I'm going to read up on it. I honestly don't know much about how flu shots evolved ..... I'll return!

Do you know anyone with really extreme side effects?", "Thank you for you\u2019re kind words :).  Mainly my issues are that I\u2019m super into natural health.  I don\u2019t get the flu shot etc., I don\u2019t over vaccinate my pets.  I\u2019m really careful about what I put in my body.\n\nI live in Maine which is lower risk for covid compared to other places.  \n\nI thought I would have more time to think about getting the vaccine but I find myself being the only one I know practically who hasn\u2019t gotten it.\n\nI work at a spa giving facials, almost everyone there has gotten it except me. \n\nI guess I\u2019m feeling a little more vulnerable now that indoor masking isn\u2019t required, so yeah, feeling a little pressure.\n\nThanks for listening!", "I'm the same! Raw dog, super wary of vaccines for her. Even tho my parents are physicians, I've always maintained that the body has an amazing ability to heal itself. That said, I'm immune suppressed from a skin disease that my body just couldn't kick itself. And I've watched COVID kill people I love, atleast one of whom was the healthiest person I had ever known. One of the last things he said to me before he went on a vent was that he was so pissed off for all the times he'd gone w kale over twinkies. I think about him a lot, actually. He knew what was happening, as it was happening, and he was petrified.\n\nWhat's harder for me is the side effects from having COVID that I'm seeing in my friends. I was just talking yesterday to my friend who is in a PHd program in Ohio, and had COVID last year and her lungs just haven't recovered. She ran an acupuncture clinic and while she was cautious, I sort of knew she wasn't cautious enough, and I'm sure she got it from a customer. She found out this week that its scar tissue so she won't recover from it. She has trouble walking up stairs or mowing the lawn. Since she's single (like me) I'm terrified of losing my self sufficiency from this, and by this, I mean COVID, not the vaccine. She's pissed people talk about COVID as if its just something you can recover from, which is true for lots of people, but not for everyone, and they just keep finding these long term side effects.\n\nI thought of it like my dog, actually. When my dog had cancer, I treated it. No amount of natural foods were going to cure her cancer, and I was so grateful for the drugs that did. And if there was a cancer vaccine, fuck YES I would take that vaccine and then figure out how to keep Mitch McConnell from taking it.\n\nRural states like Maine do have lower numbers, but are also places with lower vaccination rates, so I think your concern is pretty normal. While you decide for yourself what you want to do, could you double mask? Maybe get an air purifier for your spa room? I can recommend a few that filter down to .01 micron, which is the size of COVID. I don't think you're being overly cautious to be really concerned about getting it from patrons of the spa. I'm sorry you're at risk.\n\nDo you think you can balance the risks of the vaccine with the risks of getting COVID?", "I\u2019m sorry for you\u2019re losses.  You make some really good points.\n\nI\u2019m going to continue wearing a mask at work, and we do have air purifiers.\n\nI think yes I\u2019m starting to think not getting the vaccine is way riskier.\n\nI also believe like with cancer you can\u2019t always go natural...I get that.", "&gt; Have you looked at the heart risks like myocarditis from COVID? Have you talked to your cardiologist about it?\n\nYes, I read about it. And I do plan to speak to my cardiologist about this, because this topic is really concerning for me. Suppose that I will be the unlucky one with heavy side effects, and I will actually go through myocarditis, no matter how temporary, am I supposed to just \"deal with it\", because it is for greater good ? Because this is the stance that is broadcasted across the few subreddits I follow on this topic, and in media in general. And it bothers me to no end.\n\n&gt; But there's growing evidence that it actually prevents infection altogether. This may help understand how the herd immunity goal is rationalized. What do you think?\n\nI still think that we achieve herd immunity by having a healthcare system that can accommodate and treat patients with mild to heavy progress, instead of going and creating vaccines to simulate the virus to create a immunity response. Of course, this is a delicate topic, and I am not implying that people should just take the risk and infect themselves. But those lucky ones who had it, and recovered fully, apparently have a lot better immunity response against repeated exposure to virus than those that went with vaccination. That says a lot for a hyper-modern vaccine, that does not use an actual isolated virus.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis whole thing is testing me in a ways I never imagined. I was never anti-vaxx, my shots against TBE and tetanus prove it. I will accept booster for TBE every 3 years, and for tetanus every 10-15, because I trust them. And yet here we are, discussing potential side effects of vaccine that is expected to provide an immunity, is supposed to be more modern, and in general, just be better in every way. And yet, these new vaccines give me a lot more reasons to be concerned than feel safe. Truly modern vaccine should give us a feel of safety, not force to question whether it is a good idea to take them. That's where I am mentally now.", "No I meant side effects from COVID, not the vaccine. Have you looked into the incidents of heart issues from COVID? Obviously, your cardiologist is the best person to advise you on this. \n\nOur healthcare system is just generally SO BAD, so I don't disagree. But then, even great healthcare systems in the world are desperate for the vaccine. I wish i could have faith in a system that could care for someone with immune suppression like myself (I have a skin disease that makes you somewhat allergic to your own skin, but has been in remission a really long time w the help of prednisone). I didn't even have to think about it until COVID came alone.   \n\n\nIts not my understanding that immunity from COVID is better than the vaccine. The same way many with the vaccine get NO immunity, its also true of those with COVID. Some show no antibodies later. And we're still not sure how long those antibodies last (I read a study that said 3 months, but we're all learning as we go). \n\nIs there any govt or society in the world that has the kind of modern medicine you're thinking of?", "its hard, but remember their pressure on you comes from three places... first, they probably genuinely care about you. There's a whole societal, \"hey, if you don't want to get vaccinated, go ahead and take the risk and die, your choice\" but like, hey, I don't want you to die. That sucks. I don't want you to get sick, either.   \nAlso? They're scared for themselves. Its been the worst year and you don't know whats going on in anyone's life. maybe they're vaccinated, but don't have antibodies because like me, they're suppressed. Or got vaccinated but their kids can't be. Maybe they have aged parents whose immunity from the vaccine will be less.   \nMostly, we're all scared of the last year. What if things fester and a variant is created that beats the vaccine. Then we start all over. Everyone has lost so much. No one wants to go back to that.   \nTalk to people about it if you're comfortable, so long as they are respectful with you. We are all just trying to understand eachother.", "https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMevPdoqW/", "Get a blood test.", "&gt; No I meant side effects from COVID, not the vaccine. Have you looked into the incidents of heart issues from COVID?\n\nYes, that's what I meant by \"reading about it\". There is an evidence that a portion of people who recovered from Covid, exhibit some form of heart damage, but it varies greatly between people. My concern is, why would vaccine, designed to protect us from deadly virus, trigger similar (although quite reduced) response in our bodies ? At worst, I would expect (and accept) a normal response, like headache or maybe slight fever, but not side effects that affect the heart.\n\n&gt; Is there any govt or society in the world that has the kind of modern medicine you're thinking of?\n\nSwitzerland is being regarded as one of few countries with quite high quality of health care.

I still don't understand how we came to that point.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs for the rest, I am sorry that you have a immunosuppression problems. I hope you will keep it under wrap for as long as you can. I also did some more quick reading about immunity build post-infection vs. post-vaccine, and yes, apparently it is not a clear cut case as I thought it would be. However, I have a colleague in work who went through the infection, and his antibodies are so high that vaccine could potentially do more bad than good.\n\nPersonally, I will be waiting to see how those vaccines contribute to wiping out the virus.

Because I don't want to minimize your friends experiences, at all. When i started volunteering at the beginning of the vaccine deployment, I started to also hear these stories, and it freaked me out. But I realized at some point, I had only heard these stories secondhand. So I started doing some digging. And over the last 6 months, after helping vaccinate thousands of people in Arizona and Oregon, I can honestly say I've just never heard a single first hand story about extreme side effects. In the two cases where people thought they had these side effects, another cause was always found by a physician when they investigated. One of my friends was particularly concerned about the hormone changes she'd heard about... but by the time it was her turn, enough friends had been vaccinated without those effects she was ready to do it.   \nI think an important thing to appreciate is that we told everyone that side effects were a sign things were working, so we don't hear much from people who have no side effects, and also, there is absolutely a psychological factor here where when people feel anything, they attribute it to side effects, and in some cases, might even be creating these side effects in their head.   \nWhile I have zero doubt there are real side effects (I felt em! for like 24 hours I felt like I had the flu and camped on the couch w tylenol under a blanket) and I expect we'll eventually see some studies show that there are some grouped side effects, they're not the things we're hearing reported, like week long effects or strokes. The vaccines only real threat are those with extreme allergies, in which case they can still be vaccinated, but in a more observed setting, and blood clots, which are exceptionally rare. Your chances of being hit by lightning are worse. \n\nNew things are scary. Keep talking about it. Talk with people who've had NO side effects. Talk with people who've had COVID. I'm being real about taking a buddy with you to hold your hand (that's what I do here...I drive people and hold their hand if they're anxious about it, or whatever they need). Each city has real vaccine fairies that will do this, or ask a friend. What's important to remember is the VAST MAJORITY of people have no side effects, and that is my experience with so many people. Some people who get on a roller coaster are going to get stuck on it. But most people still take the risk. Driving is a similar risk. We all take mitigated risks, but in this case, COVID, particularly in young people is such a curse because of the long term effects on your heart, lungs, brain function.

I've helped a LOT of people get vaccinated, both by working at vaccination sites and also just helping them solve some barrier issues, so i've talked with thousands of people who've gotten vaccinated.   \nIts my experience that people generally only have a reaction to the first OR second dose. not both.

So i did some digging into VAERS and talked to pharmacists and doctors and others who work at the sites. We agree. Side effects beyond day 3 are literally unheard of first hand. Extreme side effects are also unheard of.   \nThat's not to say they don't happen, just to say, they are incredibly rare. So then it becomes about risk calculation. According to actual science, interacting with a dog and not getting bit is more likely than extreme side effects from a vaccine. So it walking outside in a rainstorm without being hit by lightning. Its more dangerous to get into a car.   \nOn the other side, COVID has a lot of known risks, and one of them is that very healthy people sometimes die from it, which is bad, but even worse, IMO, is that people experience  these insane long term side effects from COVID even if their cases were mild. heart issues, lung issues, brain issues. Its crazy.   \nYou need to do your own risk calculation, but most people generally calculate that they'd rather not risk COVID on themselves or anyone else and trust the science around vaccines. I mean, you got vaccines when you were a kid, too. An infinitesimal # of people have side effects from those, too. Some people take tylenol and have an adverse reaction.

We know nothing of this person, his medical conditions, his history, how long it was since he got the vaccine, if the vaccine is in anyway connected-we don't even know if this conversation was or wasn't staged.", "Hey. I'm Amanda. First, give yourself a break. Its normal for anyone to feel anxious about this, and we need to normalize being scared of things we can't control. We're in a freaking pandemic, we are all going through trauma and are trying to control what we can in order to feel sane. Unfortunately there are two things you can't control right now: getting COVID and how the vaccine makes you feel. All you can do is play some odds. \n\nFirst, I really, really think you should talk to your doctor. At the beginning, when it was super unclear what the advisory was for people with immune issues, or on immunosuppressive meds, there were all these opinions out there. They don't matter. No one on Reddit, including me, is going to give you a more valid opinion than your doctor. Talk to them and find out what they recommend. Even better, some physicians are now getting the vaccines in office, and might be able to give it to you there if that's the route you go. \n\nSo, I'd rely on things that are confirmed. Things we know. We don't know about the myocarditis yet as being confirmed, but we do know that its just in young men. We know the J and J blood clots are mostly in women under 50. We also know that both are exceptionally rare. Sure, you could be that 1% but the odds are literally for you here that you won't be. \n\nThe odds of getting COVID are higher, particularly as we continue on through the pandemic. So you have to just try to imagine how your body would react to the virus, not the vaccine. Would it be more likely to be survivable, have long term side effects? You and your physician need to decide this together. Most people decide the vaccine is less risky. I certainly did. \n\nBut the more important thing it brought me was euphoria. I woke up the next day and I didn't have to be obsessively careful anymore, always cautious. I had hope again, I had choices again. that was worth something to me. \n\nEverything you've been through sounds SO hard.. and there are legitimately some people that may not be able to get the vaccine and that sucks. Maybe you're one of them, but its likely you're not. Again, your physician is the person to best answer that. Mostly, try to give yourself some grace and remember that the reason people are pushing you is that they likely remember you going through all of those health crises, too and want to protect you. \n\nIf you'd like to talk more I'm available via chat.", "As I said in the original post. I'm NOT saying its related. Just saying he got it and this is what's happening. You decide if it's related. Also, not random conversation.. it's the conversation regarding my friend which is what the post you commented on.", "Yeah I actually staged the conversation earlier today and then hours later posted about it. Just out of pure entertainment. Idiot.", "So you just comment on everyone that saying something you don't want to hear about vaccines. Got it.", "I'm not calling you a terrible person. I expect you're a scared person, or anxious person, or someone who just went through the same trauma as all of us and is looking for things they can control. Sadly, we have 2 things we just can't- how you'll be affected by the vaccine and how you'll be affected by COVID. Its an odds game. \n\nSo... what are your odds of getting COVID? Only you can say. It depends on the spaces you go into, and how protected you are when you're in them and how many other people go into those spaces, etc. It depends on how many cases are local, etc. Are you still double masking? Are you protecting your eyes? Are you ever unmasked anyplace besides your own home, where only you are? Then there's risk. \n\nEven if you're the ideal case where you get tested immediately on feeling any symptoms, [most transmission comes from asymptomatic folx](https://www.advisory.com/en/daily-briefing/2021/01/11/asymptomatic-spread), meaning you wouldn't feel symptoms. [And 30% of COVID cases are asymptomatic](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/08/10/asymptomatic) so one out of every three people who get COVID won't know it. So I'm building the case here that its likely if you got it, you wouldn't know it, and being asymptomatic, you'd be very likely to spread it.  While being very careful about not getting it would surely reduce your risk, it would not eliminate it. We all know plenty of people who got it while being \"very careful\". None of this begins to delve into how COVID might affect you, the short or long term effects, its just how it would affect other people, since that was the question. \n\nSo if the people you're around are vaccinated, their risk is reduced, because we know that most people form antibodies after the vaccine. Most people. But what we don't know is how much for each individual. We have averages in the 90% range, which is amazing. But that's not 100%, and also it varies based on criteria like age and immune system. Some people get vaccinated and have no antibodies whatsoever. Even more troubling? There's no good test yet to find out if you have antibodies. Tons on the market. None of them accurate. (This is pretty common knowledge now but lmk if you'd like references). \n\nBut we also know that those who are vaccinated, even if they get COVID, [have a reduced risk of asymptomatic transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html) (because most people who get COVID post vaxx will be asymptomatic). So you being vaccinated reduces the risk to you, and reduces the risk to them. \n\nSo while none of these factors or variables eliminate the risk or bring it to zero, they all work to reduce the risk. You being careful reduces it, wearing 2 masks, staying out of shared spaces, social distancing from family, but the most singularly big risk reduction you can have is both parties being vaccinated, you and them.", "Some people get hit by lightning (more people than get blood clots from the J and J vaccine, btw). But if someone posts about it here, its SO rare that you might not believe the person posting it.", "Didn't mean you specifically, I was more referring to the general response I've seen people get, I'm sure some of them were dicks but I've also seen people just being concerned who get attacked for it too. So if someone has antibodies from the vaccine they would get rid of the virus almost entirely from their body and that's what makes them less contagious? Since they aren't carrying as much of the virus?\n\nAlso, has it been documented that younger people's immune systems aren't able to produce these antibodies on their own? Because I understand older people or people's whose immune systems are compromised needing to take the vaccine, but I'm not sure why completely healthy young people would need this assistance? The vaccine is so new and already had a type discontinued if I'm correct, so it is a little frightening to me to have it given to me since I don't think there has been any proper testing and there definitely hasn't been any tests on how it effects people long term. I really don't want to harm anyone, but I don't want to harm myself either.", "[This is your bio, is it not?](https://imgur.com/a/j2lH8fY)", "U mad, bro?", "Seems like you have the free time lol read that last part of that bio.", "Not at all pimp just seeing what kind of bullshit you on and it definitely shows why you commenting on my posts dick riding vaccines.", "&gt;So if someone has antibodies from the vaccine they would get rid of the virus almost entirely from their body and that's what makes them less contagious? Since they aren't carrying as much of the virus?\n\nIf someone has antibodies from the vaccine, they are 90%ish less likely to GET COVID, and you can't give it to others if you don't have it, and as of that study I quoted above, they are less likely to pass it along even if they DO get COVID. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Also, has it been documented that younger people's immune systems aren't able to produce these antibodies on their own? Because I understand older people or people's whose immune systems are compromised needing to take the vaccine, but I'm not sure why completely healthy young people would need this assistance? \n\nWe're talking about 2 different things here. So lets start with the first. The only way people form antibodies to COVID is either by being infected or being vaccinated. Not everyone who gets COVID forms antibodies, not everyone who gets vaccinated forms antibodies. But in BOTH cases, [most people](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/05/07/study-finds-nearly-everyone-who-recovers-from-covid-19-makes-coronavirus-antibodies) [form antibodies.](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-response-vaccination-after-covid-19)\n\n[Its been documented that older people are more likely to form a lower antibody response.](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-021-00219-y) But the idea that healthy young people are immune to poor health isn't rational. Young healthy people break their bones. They get the flu, colds, pneumonia, While a healthy immune system might help you prevent getting COVID and might make you more likely to survive, its not a shield. This is a pandemic for a reason. And plenty of very healthy young people died, and even those who survived, [many](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/05/210506125817.htm) have[long term health effects-](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html) heart, lung, brain. You could argue that the risk of long term brain fog or scarred lung tissue (that can't recover) in a young healthy person is something you'd like to work hard to avoid. \n\nSo while you COULD get COVID and be fine, the longer we are in this, the less likely that is. And its not as simple as \"COVID\" anymore, because the newer strains are more contagious and [seem to affect younger people more](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/health/b117-covid-variant-young-patients/index.html) (the numbers of kids infected are rising).", "Well, you clearly have the observational abilities of a brick...considering I'm replying to a comment made on a post *I* made as the OP....", "I did.

Since you ask, I will give you  what was my thought more than a year ago, March 2020.\n\nI believe the first of defense should be a simple, inexpensive, fast-to-market vaccine to serve 2 purposes:  \n\n   1. First shot:  protect anyone might have died to getting sicked only, but still can suffered serious illness.  Protect anyone who might have suffer serious illness to suffer only moderate illness.\n\n   2. Second shot: protect anyone might have died to only get some moderate illness.  Protect anyone who might suffer serious illness to almost no illness.\n\n   3.  Third shot: Common sense, more shot more protection.\n\nThe idea is to practice your immune system to become aggressive, and fight Covid ASAP it enters the body, cut down the incubation period.  In fact I even thought of having a Covid spay to provoke the body where it needs to fight the most, the place where Covid would first enter.\n\nWeekly spay would be good. \n\nThat said, Covaxin fits my mentality.  More importantly, it's an inactive vaccine.  It does not contain any virus that actively modify your body cells.  Most Americans are very ignorant, borderline of being stupid.  Perhaps CDC thinks it's ok to have some brain cells got modified by the cross fired, but to me that is unacceptable.  Just say so:  Americans, you are stupid, Chinese folks have more brain cells so they could only use inactive vaccine which is less effective.\n\nBtw, in my life time, I have not met a local born American who came even near to my intellectual power.  I used to work in IBM Almaden Research among the best of the best in USA.  By far, the hidden dragon lady and I were much smarter than ALL Americans we met here and some were supposed to be top 1-2 PhD from best school in USA.  Shocking, I would like to be defeated here intellectually or America is doomed.\n\nOh, one more point, Covaxin is inexpensive, 1/10th of the price compared to most other vaccine.

So, to echo what people below said... this is for sure, a 100% trust your physician situation. If they advise it, do it. It makes sense they do, because the cardiovascular side effects of COVID, even if you survive it, are bonkers, unpredictable and often long term. \n\nWhen people have side effects, they enter them into a system called VAERS. The thing is, remember that these are self reported. So its not that everything entered is a result of the vaccine, its that they got vaccinated and at some point after that had something else happen. This isn't a causal relationship. That's why the next step is that scientists step in and investigate. \n\nThere's another thing to consider, which is this: since we've made people nutty about side effects and how they're proof its all working, you have to acknowledge there is some degree of psychosomaticism here. Meaning, we are manifesting the severity of and quantity of side effects. People have palpitations all the time, but its possible that your wife, already aware that you were anxious about this exact thing, and having spent a lot of time around someone deeply enmeshed in cardiac care, was hypersensitive and hyperaware and thus.. palpitations. \n\nbeing anxious about this all is totally normal and expected. What I'd ask is that you do some risk analysis. COVID vs the vaccine. Things are changing rapidly here, with mask mandates going away. How, in Florida, a regular human avoids COVID is frankly beyond me, its crazytown there. But just because you've avoided it til now in no way means you can avoid it in the future. that's unknown. Moreover, Florida is a realistic entry point of new strains, which have shown to be more infectious. Because of your weight (no judgement, I'm fat) you are more likely to get it, to have serious side effects, and be hospitalized. That's scientific fact.  On the other side, you've got the vaccine. \n\nYour risk there is minimal. Science has already suggested it, no matter what anyone on reddit says. There is a minute (its seriously tiny) chance that you might experience side effects both short and long term (short is more likely) , but those are both infinitesimally small. For perspective: less than going out in the rain and getting hit by lightning. Less than getting in a car and getting into an accident. Less than playing with a dog and getting bit. \n\nWeigh those.

They are experimental gene therapy. No product that\u2019s been around for such a short time as these are has been properly field tested. There is no way of knowing what long term effects or side effects they might have. Anyone who tells you differently is lying to you. It\u2019s a simple fact. I think it\u2019s a bit strange the way they are trying to entice people into receiving the jab with cash and prizes. You might also research how a large percentage of new covid cases are people who have taken the shot. Research the different brands. One brand was completely banned from Italy all together. Find out why. There are many reports of injury and or Death within short time periods after the jab. Some true, some have been discredited. There have been stories of journalists being silenced for reporting their views or information they have obtained. Some of these are most likely true and some false. The bottom line is Any decision you make will be somewhat ill informed. These are troublesome times we are living in. Trust your gut. Instinct in times like this is our best asset. Instinct is what teaches the spider to make the web. Or teaches the octopus how to hunt and not be hunted. Read articles and find out their sources. I cannot stress that enough. Where is the information coming from?this type of research should help you to make a decision that you will feel good about. This is the biggest vaccination campaign in the history of Man. Don\u2019t feel rushed. Polio wasn\u2019t wiped out for like 30 years after they started vaccinating. Some people of your age are experiencing an enlarged heart after receiving the jab. This is a fact even the mainstream media has reported on. I\u2019m sure there are many who will jump on me for the things that I have said in my response but I don\u2019t care. I know that my decisions are made with as much information as I can find from reliable sources. And you will find \u201creliable sources\u201d on both ends of the vaccine argument.

I am not vaccinated, but would like to be vaccinated, but genuinely hesitant.  When I bring up my vaccine hesitancy IRL, I almost immediately get the labels of 'uneducated rightwing conspiracy nut', to the point where I simply just don't bring it up.  I am in fact not antivax.  Due to the amount of traveling I have done over the years I have had about 50 or more adult vaccinations, taken long term preventative drugs based on geographic location concerns, I get the flu vaccine every year, I am educated, and I am about as far left on the social ideology spectrum as one can go.  But yes, I am hesitant to the point of confusion with the current vaccine, due to reasons I will list below.  Please feel free to dispel them for me.  I do not do conspiracy theories, so please provide advice free from any of that stuff. \n\n  \n\\- I am point blank just scared of the shot (I tried to think of a more eloquent way to put it, but can't).  Its new, there are no long term trials/studies on it in regards to humans, I have pretty bad anxiety as it is, and its a very new method of vaccination.  Most of the traditional vaccines we have had in our lifetime have used a method of introducing a live or inactivated form of whatever its is we are vaccinating against.  This introduction allows our body to memorize how to fight said virus.  With the newer vaccines using mRNA technology, it is not accomplished via the same mechanisms.  A recent Harvard and MIT study even suggest that the mRNA vaccines might permanently alter our DNA; this possible finding is in direct conflict with CDC's statement that vaccines absolutely do not permanently alter or interact with ones DNA.  When I read newer studies like this that contradict health guidelines, it just makes me nervous (not nervous in the fact that I think there is a mass conspiracy going on, but nervous in the fact that there is still a lot we don't know about certain things).  Particularly as it relates to technology that has never been used in humans before.\n\n  \n\\- There seems to have been a wholesale neglect of the concepts of natural immunity.  People post COVID infection have been instructed to get the vaccine anyway, even contrary to well established historical literature of natural immunity.  I have never tested positive for COVID mind you, but I am fairly certain I have had it; but its extremely difficult to get an antibody test to confirm - far more difficult than it is to get a PCR test.  When I look at some of the statistical data of reinfection for someone post COVID, its almost null.  I mean it is extremely extremely low, and as close to zero as you can get.  Then I look at the breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated individuals, and its quite a lot (I understand that the vaccine does not prevent infection, but more so it prevents severe outcomes to infection).  When I lay those two data points side by side, I interpret it as having natural immunity through infection as being a bit more superior than an actual vaccine (this has traditionally been the case with most virus throughout history).  Why then are we not talking more about the individuals who are post COVID infection, and factoring them into a lot of the decisions we are making?\n\n  \n\\- I have done my best to go on a media blackout because its almost to much to read and rarely contains anything truly useful.  Admittedly though, the way the media has covered the pandemic has affected me for the worse.  What I view as the constant fear proselytizing has had an opposite affect on me in regards to the pandemic and the current vaccine.  \n\n\nWell, those are the main points I guess.  I abhor conspiracy theories, I don't believe the vaccine magnetizes you, I don't believe 5G towers give you COVID, or any other number of outlandish things.  I am just someone who is hesitant.  I want to do the right thing and I would see my current beliefs (as with my beliefs on most things) are fluid and never permanent.", "5 of 5 people that get vaccinated are not immune. Why do people think this? It\u2019s fake news. The vaccination carries zero immunity to it and the only positive to getting it is it has a 50% chance to keep you out the hospital. You will still get sick. You can still pass the virus just as easy with or with out the vaccine. The vaccine is just a ploy to buy more time for your countries \u201cleaders\u201d. Look at USA, most clueless brain dead government in the world but they claim to know what they are doing and talking about. Don\u2019t think a dementia patient and former prostitute are going to be close to know what to do but those ignorant people there voted them into power and now look at them. Every body hates the old man and slut the USA have in control right now \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 laughing stock of the world is the USA", "You are right about IQs, though they do do one thing well: Predict school performance. Not surprising, since that is what they were originally designed to do.", "I recovered from Covid and have natural immunity so I do not need to inject myself with a potentially harmful, experimental mRNA with no long term safety data. Not to mention the fact that these vaccines are quickly losing efficacy with the new variants. They also do not prevent you from getting infected and you can still spread the virus to others. So tell me with all of this- why would you get the injection?? That\u2019s the real question.", "Great reasons! I feel the same as you. I have confirmed natural immunity and have a great deal of confidence in that.  Very soon it will be impossible to deny that these new vaccines don\u2019t work very well and that they are in fact harmful to a great many people. Hold strong because the push is about to get much stronger in the coming months.", "It seems like you have a very strong bias towards getting vaccinated, you have the right to your opinion. But, you need to understand that there are numerous virologists, scientists, and doctors that clearly state that yes, the vaccine saves lives, but there are still many unknowns, which is a fact. The narrative that is very one-sided right now, is get vaccinated, it is safe &amp; effective and you are a horrible, irresponsible and bad person who is driving the spread of covid, if you dont get it. Which is a total lie, because vaccinated people, still are getting covid, and spreading it too.  I wish there was more transparency, and clear unbiased data.  Which there is not right now.  There is so much political and financial drive behind the vaccine rollout, that I have never seen in my whole life.  I am 50, I have every vaccine that is necessary, and I never had to be shamed, coerced, bribed, or fear-Mongered into getting any of my other boosters or vaccines.  This one is a novel vaccine, it is normal to question its long-term safety.  And yes, many auto immune and long term problems, take a year or so to develop.  This is scientific, this is known, and it is not conspiracy. So, I understand that you are pro-covid vaccine.  Great, but I feel that you are one sided.  I am truly sitting in the middle, watching this whole thing unfold, and trying to navigate to find the truth. Just because one camp is pro vaccine, and another camp is anti vaccine, does not give them the truth right now.  TIME, will be the truth teller in my opinion.  And, in this day of censorship, I feel like we are just not getting accurate data. It is all biased one way or another. So, that\u2019s why I am cautious.  I think any person that thinks about things, would be cautious about injecting a novel vaccine with permanent function on their immune response.", "So somebody who clearly doesn't have immune issues. I do so like everybody else with actual immune issues we are all thrilled to have something that can save us. You're being absurd.", "And you are name-calling by saying I am being absurd.  Like I said, you are not a good source of information, because you are very biased towards the narrative that is being sold on the media right now. Also, I think you like to argue with people from what I see, and to \u201cprove\u201d them \u201cwrong\u201d in their feelings.  Which I just can\u2019t be bothered with people that are highly biased.  You have made your decision already.  I have not, it does not make me, absurd. I am a very highly educated, and professional person.  Not absurd by any means.", "Not entirely sure when we all became so fragile that even the simplest word like absurd is taken as an insult. \nI approached the vaccines in the same way as most people which was was some degree of fear and some degree of excitement. Because we just didn't know until they released the data.\nBut then, I was able to recognize that despite being a highly educated person with multiple college degrees that comes from a family full of physicians, and if someone who is spent a large portion of my life around doctors because of my medical condition, I did not go to school for 8 years to study medicine. I did not intern, I did not do the work to become a physician. I do not know better than physicians. I, my one person, do not know better than the entire medical and scientific establishment. \nYou know that commercial where they say 9 out of 10 dentists recommend blah blah blah? There's always that one dentist and you got to wonder what his argument is but I still can look at the nine and say hey. There's greater likelihood that they're right. In that case we're talking about gum not saving lives. \nI also acknowledge that I am not more important than other people. I have great respect for my community, and I owe my life to physicians and nurses. I'm not going to put them more at risk than they have to be after the worst year of their lives. I can look at the world and recognize that the major problem we're having right now is no longer covid but unvaccinated humans. And to go one step further it is a unique problem to white nations. Most countries in the world would kill to have our privilege and here you are wasting it.\nYou take far greater risks everyday getting into a car walking in the rain or being around dogs. And yet I'm sure you still get into cars, or don't run inside when it starts raining or run away from dogs. Each of those presents a greater threat to your life than the vaccine does. That is the origin of the word absurd. The majority of the people in this thread including yourself have made the point over and over again that it really doesn't have to do with science you just don't like having something shoved down your throat. \nAnd yet, it wouldn't be shut down your throat if you had acted rationally. We have more disinformation now than we did with previous vaccine rollouts but if we had had this at the time of polio we'd still all be dealing with polio.\nBias is a rough word. It suggests an uneducated leaning. Yes I am for vaccines in the same way I'm for education, that I'm for eating every day, that I'm for seeking medical treatment when you're hurt, that I'm for drinking water. That's not bias it's just common sense and you want to make yourself feel better by suggesting that the one in 10 dentists backs up your assertion... But that's absurdity. It's a weak argument. And what's worse is that you know it is and yet you maintain it over and over again. \nYou are not special. You are a member of the community. Your life is not more deserving. You do not deserve special treatment. We all deserve to live in a safe world where we take care of each other... That is your responsibility to everyone else. \nOnly in America, specifically white people in America... Do they maintain this absurd line. \nIf you hear that as an insult that's about you, not anything that I said.", "Check out r/Qanoncasaulties unfortunately there are a lot of people suffering from this awful situation.  Good luck and glad you at least were able to get the vaccine!  They are some really sad stories from young kids whose even younger siblings got really really sick from parents who brought Covid home", "Good info!", "Well, if you read the very first post. It was stating, that I was on the fence. Your argument still does not give me any 2 year long-term data. Nothing will but time. When everyone that has been vaccinated goes through the next wave, and don\u2019t get sick or transmit covid, it will give me a more clear picture of the benefit/risk ratio. What I suppose I was stating in my first post, was that people that are unsure, and still want more verifiable data, are being labeled, and segregated, called names, called conspiracy theorists, and anti-vaxxers, and even worse, the drivers and the people that are continuing the pandemic, which is not true at all.  The vaccine does not neutralize covid. So, the unvaccinated are not driving the spread.  Covid just spreads as it will.  We most likely will never reach herd immunity at this point because of emerging variants.  So, yes, I am still fence sitting.  Call me what you will, but I am still going to wait.  I know 2 people that were hospitalized and almost lost their lives due to covid.  They still suffer. I in NO way laugh at covid, nor am I an anti-masker, or a protester.  Covid is real, but so are my and millions of others\u2019 concerns about the vaccine.  If I could get a traditional vaccine like J&amp;J, I would in a heartbeat. (The tiny risks of clots can be fully avoided if they would just aspirate before injection, to make sure it is not being injected into a vein and truly in the muscle) ***which is more rare than aspirin reaction really.  But, I do not live in the USA, and we only have the pfizer and moderna vaccines.  here. So\u2026I suppose I take my chances and wait.", "This is why I'm saying that you're absurd: suggesting that being vaccinated and unvaccinated have the same risk of getting in transmitting covid when you know that's not remotely true. Vaccines are not a silver bullet but I imagine you wear a seatbelt in the car and that's not a silver bullet either, it's a layer of risk mitigation. Masking is a layer of risk mitigation, two masks is a higher level. Two masks plus social distancing is a higher level from that, staying outside is a higher level of risk mitigation but the one layer of risk mitigation that is inarguable is vaccination and no rational person can look at the numbers out there and argue with that. States with bad vaccination numbers have high levels of covid. Over 95% of current hospitalizations for covid are unvaccinated people. Testing for covid has almost disappeared but you and I can probably agree that if there was more comprehensive testing, the vast majority would be on vaccinated people and in very small situations where they're surveillance testing, whether that's film sets or congregate settings or Cruise ships, the numbers all bear that out, the vast majority of people testing positive are unvaccinated. \nWe now have 18 months of data.

Keep in mind, only about 1% of all potential side effects are  actually reported. Some say that VAERS is cooking the books and deleting bad data. I personally have no idea. Use your own best judgment.\n\nWhat is the survivability rate of Covid? Pretty darn high.\n\nAre there long term studies proving the vaccine is safe. No. It''s experimental. No one knows the long term outcomes for people who've gotten it. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you. This was literally rushed through last year. To repeat, no one knows that the long term effects will be - good or bad.\n\nDoes the vaccine appear to prevent infection in the vaccinated? No. they are still getting infected at high rates.\n\nDoes the vaccine appear to compromise your immune system? Some say yes, others no. You'll have to decide.\n\nCould the vaccine affect fertility? Don't know. Some believe it does.\n\nIs the vaccine the cause of miscarriages in pregnant women who take it? Don't know. Again, some believe it is.\n\nWill the vaccine cause birth defects in babies born to women who are currently pregnant and got vaccinated, or who will become pregnant in the future and are vaccinated, who received the vaccine?  Again, I don't know and I don't think it's been on the market long enough for anyone to say with any certainty what long term reproductive effects and incidences of birth defects would be.\n\nFor myself, I'm passing on the vaccine ... for now. If down the road it turns out to be as safe as the pro-vaccinators say, then I may consider it. I literally have received every other vaccine available except for chicken pox since I have natural immunity. I am not an anti-vaccinator by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nHowever, with the high probability of survival if infected, and the potential hazards of taking an experimental, and somewhat doubtful (re: actual effectiveness) vaccine, it doesn't pass my risk/benefit analysis at this point in time.\n\nGood luck with your decision. Try not to succumb to peer pressure on either side. My advice is to make your decision and then keep it to yourself.", "You (vaccinated individual) can pass on COVID just as much as he (unvaccinated ) can.

You should also consider getting an antibody test since the consensus seems to be that natural immunity provides robust defense (several studies on this). The job of public health officials is to lie to the public by overstating the benefits of vaccination while understating the risk, because individual risk/benefit analysis would result in a large segment of the population not getting vaccinated. Probably, judging from the available data, the risk of serious side effects with these vaccines is higher than that from conventional vaccines, but still remains low (perhaps negligible). If you're really concerned, you can consider waiting for more conventional vaccines to be approved such as Novavax.  Another thing to consider is vaccination rates and transmission in your area. If, for example, 70% of your area is vaccinated with a vaccine with a 80-85% average efficacy rate, the chance of being exposed is pretty low.", "If you lie, and she dies consequently from the shot;  the law will come after you.", "Nothing I said above asked for ANY personal information or has ANY bearing on your life, sir.

Therefore, participants in the AstraZ trial had a higher probability of being exposed, and when they were exposed it was more often to one of the variants that the vaccines are less effective protecting against.

There are real side effects to the vaccine, and that's generally a good thing. But also we're all so exposed to the propaganda about side effects, there's a real psychosomatic effect here. That level of anxiety? OF COURSE you're tired. That's a lot for a body to deal with. \n\nWhat the vast, overwhelming majority of people experience is some flu symptoms and a fever and it lasts 24 hours or less. Just ensure you are well hydrated and you move your arm, that's all. \n\nAgain, nothing compares to actually having COVID. \n\nIf you need support while getting your second shot or before or after, just shoot me a chat. I'm happy to help talk to you about it. Also, ignore the shit below, most of it is bunk.", "Hi. I've been working with a ton of people getting vaccinated, so two things to keep in mind. \n\n1. while MOST people have a reaction to their second shot, some people experience it on their first. but the good news is, no one has a reaction to both shots. Its one or the other. Its your body's response, and sometimes it has one on the first shot. \n2. You're not protected until 2 weeks after the second shot. There are an alarming number of people who get COVID between shot 1 and 2. I have nothing to back up this assertion, but it makes sense to me that people are getting it at pharmacies, etc. Unlike vaccination centers, pharmacies are shit at keeping people apart, and in the US, they've all unmasked, and everyone there is by definition, unvaccinated. So, when you go for your shot, MASK UP. Keep distance. Protect yourself. \n\nNow, how do you tell the difference? If 48 hours from now you still feel like crap, get a COVID test and isolate until you get the results.", "Yeah, I'm gonna get it now rather than 3 weeks later because as you said protection is highly important as cases are quickly rising. Thank you for your answer. \ud83d\ude4f", "You're putting things in black and white. \"do masks work?\"\n\nFirst, here's why you can't just mask and prevent infection. Nothing is 100% in this world except death and taxes:)  With COVID, all we can do so far is layers of risk mitigation. Masks are a layer. One cloth mask is... not a lot of mitigation. 2 masks or an n95 mask are better risk mitigation. But your eyes are still a vector... and masks aren't 100% because you're not in full PPE:) So, distancing adds another layer of mitigation, and then being outside is a HUGE mitigation, and finally.... vaccination. Vaccination reduces your risk of infection by 60-80%, and if you get COVID, reduces your symptoms. Even in areas with decent masking, we still saw high levels of infection. And that was before Delta, which is 2x as transmissable as Alpha. Its a game changed. If you're unvaccinated, unless you're living in a cave, you're very likely to get COVID. \n\nNow.... onto the first part. Why don't we insist on vaccines for... Ebola and SARS. Both are relatively simple: they're not pandemics. If Ebola hit the US the way it hit Africa, you best be sure we'd have a vaccine and some form of national protections like lockdowns, etc. But Neither Ebola or SARS ever hit first world nations in a measurable way. What HAS hit those nations? Chicken pox. Polio. etc. And for THOSE illnesses, there are vaccines and those are largely mandated. \n\nAlso.. I'm not sure why you think half the world isn't at risk of COVID. Its a worldwide pandemic. Is there an area you can point to where people aren't at risk?", "There is no scientific data that suggests smokers are at greater risk from a vaccine. They are, however at vastly greater risk of contracting and suffering from COVID. I know plenty of smokers who've been vaccinated without any incident. (let me rephrase that. ALL the smokers I know who've been vaccinated, have received the vaccine without incident). \n\nWithdrawal from smoking would also have no effect on how you felt from the vaccine, but would separately probably be a tough thing on your body. My advice is to get vaccinated ASAP, and worry about the smoking separately. Patch, whatever. Doesn't matter. While quitting is great... (and you should, I was super happy when i did!) your health is at far greater risk from COVID right now.", "As of this week, yes. Here is what we now know, and guidance changed THIS week. \n\nWhile vaccinations still prevent infection from the Delta variant anywhere from 60-80%, obviously, that leaves room for vaccinated folx to get infected. And... when they do, they can transmit it to others just as well as unvaccinated folx. So... its been recommended by the CDC to mask up again, and we're seeing, in the US, lots of new mask mandates. Delta is just much more transmissable than previous versions of COVID. \n\nSo yeah.... mask up! Also, stay outside if you can. The air exchange outside, with like 6' of distance reduces your risk to almost 0.", "Hi. I'll keep it short. \n\nVaccination prevents infection in 60-80% of cases from COVID. When there is a breakthrough case in vaccinated people, the symptoms are far, far less severe, reducing your risk of hospitalization and death to almost 0. \n\nSo yes, Some vaccinated people will still get COVID. But most will not. And when they get it, it will be less severe, and they won't die or be hospitalized. \n\nVs unvaccinated people, who are much more likely to get COVID now w this variant due to how transmissable it is, and also are more likely to have severe illness, because that's how Delta works. \n\nIn short, get vaccinated.", "Actually, it still prevents it in 60-80% of people. and ALSO decreases severity if you do get it but does NOT reduce spread. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people spread Delta the same, as of this week.", "yeah. he was wrong and the CDC always knew he was wrong, but Biden is not awesome at nuance.", "eh. He's not killing people because the vaccine doesn't kill people. COVID does. But I agree, he stumbles. Ultimately, people are better served by being vaccinated then not.", "Hey. I'm a vaccine fairy. My name is Amanda. It sounds like you want the vaccine, but have some fear about it. Can we chat about it? I can answer questions, we can talk about your concerns and some coping mechanisms. This is something I often do for people.", "&gt;When there is a breakthrough case in vaccinated people, the symptoms are far, far less severe, reducing your risk of hospitalization and death to almost 0.\n\nthe variants are recent, aren't they? Has this been proven?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyre saying the variants are so different that theyre more contagious than chicken pox at this point, that you must stay masked even in your home with your children, what is going on?", "Again, hard words. \"Recent\". Delta has been identified as a variant of concern for a bit, but because testing has diminished, its harder to track what's going on. MOST of the update to this week is due to one cluster, in Provincetown, MA over 4th of July weekend. now, a few things to know. Ptown is a summer town, and there are LEGIONS of tourists over the summer. Pop swells by 800%. Think about that. And while Massachusetts has a very high vaccination rate (70%) Ptowns is EVEN HIGHER (114%, not kidding. [https://www.masslive.com/capecod/2021/07/how-provincetown-achieved-a-114-vaccination-rate.html](https://www.masslive.com/capecod/2021/07/how-provincetown-achieved-a-114-vaccination-rate.html))\n\n4th of July weekend was packed bars, packed restaurants (Ptown itself is tiny, with only one block of stores/bars/etc, I used to live there). And, everyone is vaccinated, and they've been told if you're vaccinated, you're ok to be unmasked! So, people gathered,in super close proximity (I should add, Ptown is destination for the LGBTQIA pop, and like Block Island, summer means dance parties, etc) so when we're probably talking closer than your average concert experience. \n\nAnd there was a cluster of cases, just short of 500. But, the majority of those people were vaccinated. AND when they looked at PCR tests, they found the vaccinated had just as high viral loads as the unvaccinated. So it was just as transmissable from the vaccinated as the unvaccinated. This was new information, that hasn't happened before. \n\nNow. I want to be clear about the takeaway. Vaccinations STILL work. They still prevent infection by 60-80% (I use this number because studies have shown anywhere from 66-88% so understand its an estimate). PREVENT infection altogether. But when people DO get infected, they can transmit the virus as easily as anyone else. \n\nYou should not hear that vaccinated people are now spreading it more than unvaccinated people or that there's no point to getting vaccinated because you can get it anyways. There were likely almost no unvaccinated people IN Provincetown that weekend, because of the above stats. It could be that every single unvaccinated person who was in contact got it, and that if everyone was unvaccinated, the spread could have been thousands. \n\nBut also, that vaccinated people? No hospitalizatoins. No deaths (like seriously, that number approaches zero). While on the unvaccinated, Delta is more severe than previous versions of COVID. \n\nAnd? Gamma and Lambda are on their way. Now, we don't know that they'll be more transmissable or severe than Delta, just that there will continue to be variants. \n\nSo lets talk about WHY there are variants. \n\nViruses mutate. They mutate like dogs beg. Its just what they DO. But they can only do that if they have host bodies to do it IN. So, part of the reason the vaccinations are so important is that when we let people \"just get it and let their natural immunity take over\" they're providing a host body for a mutation. So, lets play some numbers. \n\nLets say that the infection rate of COVID, delta is 80%. if you're unvaccinated, its 80% likely you'll get it. This feels decently accurate, but lets say its a guess. But if you're unvaccinated, you're only 20-30% likely to get it. So just on infection alone, that's a dramatic drop in numbers of infections. Think about that at the US population level. We're talking millions of people. Maybe a billion. A Billion less chances for mutation.", "Well the things that you\u2019re explaining was well researched by myself before my 1st Astra dose. In the ideal circumstances I would wait for 5 more years and get a single shot, well tested, proven, peer reviewed vaccine. But hey this is the new normal now and if the counties like Canada n Germany are wrong about mixing the jab then fuck me dead mate. You take a safe haven road and I\u2019ll take my chances to protect myself against the variants.\n\nFYI: the side effects were massive as expected within 12-48hrs but I\u2019m alive and that\u2019s all i care at this moment.", "Second note: wherever you're going to GET the shot? Mask up. Do not mask up a little, mask up a LOT. Double mask or wear an N95 and don't dick around about it.

It's mostly transmitted through physical contact, and its unclear whether it would be able to spread at all in Western countries once the news put out the word that Ebola is now a threat and you should not touch your dead relatives if they died of it...\n\nSARS is most comparable to regular COVID (the variants are much more transmissible), and people in the worst affected areas were wearing masks. Other countermeasures were also taken (e.g. isolating cases etc., and in the affected areas in Asia, lockdowns).\n\nIt boils down to \"how many other people does one infected person infect on average\", and you need to take measures until that number (called the reproduction number, R) is smaller than 1. Early on, contact tracing and isolating cases works well. Once there are too many cases to trace, other measures are necessary.\n\nI don't know why it worked with SARS and not COVID-19, since they're considered to have a similar ability to spread in the absence of measures. Maybe the response to it started earlier (China also kept SARS under wraps for a while, but maybe not as long as COVID). Maybe COVID-19 is *slightly* more infectious. Maybe COVID-19 \"hides\" better (allowing people to spread it before they show symptoms), making the interventions less effective. Maybe after the success with SARS people weren't taking the warnings seriously this time (I sure wasn't, until it became clear that it's worse than that).\n\n&gt; But why can't I just wear a mask to prevent me spreading or catching covid? Don't masks work??\n\nMasks *reduce* spread, they don't stop it. Let's say R is 3, and masks are 50% effective. If you introduce masks, it's still going to spread, just slower (R=1.5). Instead of having (on average) 1 person infected, then 3, then 9, then 27, you will have 1, then 1.5, then 2.3, then 3.4 etc.\n\nRemember, we have to take measures until R&lt;1. Those measures don't *have* to be masks, but masks are a lot less annoying than lockdowns, and unlike contact tracing, they aren't limited to situations with little spread. The measures don't even have to be government mandated. People who don't want to get sick may choose to avoid risky activities, which also reduces spread. Public transit in many cities suffered because many people started avoiding it. Vaccinations and past infections also reduce the ability to spread.\n\nIt's also not the only virus that requires the world to be vaccinated. Many \"children's diseases\" like measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, polio have (had) widespread vaccination, sometimes with semi-mandates (e.g. can't send your child to school without vaccines, or you theoretically get to decide, but if you say no it's child abuse, etc.), other times simply because people still knew how horrible those diseases were. These diseases are now rare, due to vaccination. Before vaccines became available, *everyone* would be infected. Most would recover, some would die or be crippled, that was life.\n\nParents intentionally exposed their kids as a form of vaccination because kids recovered much better than adults - if you didn't get it as a kid, you were likely to get it later and then much more likely to die from it.\n\nEbola didn't even have a vaccine until recently, because it wasn't enough of a problem in rich countries (brutal but true). I'm not sure if there is a SARS vaccine - I think the virus was eradicated before they could test them, but the work started on them helped develop the COVID vaccine faster.", "While nothing is 100% safe, I consider the risk from being exposed to the virus without having the vaccine first higher than the risk from the vaccine + getting the virus while vaccinated. Simple as that. It's not \"vaccine or no vaccine\", if there was no virus then obviously \"no vaccine\" would be better. It's \"vaccine and less severely affected by the virus\" or \"no vaccine but full virus\".\n\nIf this was something that you're unlikely to encounter like smallpox or Ebola, the calculus would be different.

Im a vaccine fairy, which means that I help people figure out how to get vaccinated if they want to be. I think you have two separate issues, and I'm going to be honest, that second issue is far more concerning, because it threatens your security, and that kind of ongoing anxiety isn't good for you, and because you deserve better. Lets try to deal with that first. Do you want to talk more about this on chat, maybe? Reddit doesn't deserve all your life details, but if you need support, I'd be happy to talk you through some options. \n\nSo, here's the thing about getting vaccinated. You're the perfect example of \"its not always a light case if you're young\". It sucked and it hurt you financially and physically. You survived, and I'm grateful you did, because your life matters. But, because of your symptoms, lets negate your age and general health, because usually people use those as reasons why they'd likely not suffer from COVID, but you already know exactly how you'd suffer from COVID, so its irrelevant. You would likely survive, but it would suck. The only thing I'd ask about this is: are you SURE it was COVID (did you get a positive test?) I completely understand why people assume their illnesses in 2020-21 were COVID, but often, they're something else. \n\nSo, lets talk reinfection. Reinfection happens, though rarely. 1% or less in patients with SEVERE COVID... and its iffy if that's what you had (both, was it COVID, and also, was it severe?) But we're seeing it now a little more commonly. That said, its still a small chance, for now. We don't have new studies since Delta variant, and in the last week we've heard a number of stories of 2nd infections in the public, and I'm taking an educated guess, but I think new variants with enough difference will cause that number to go up. That said, 1% is so low it'd have to go up a LOT for it to be a real risk. \n\nAs for side effects.... this is irrelevant. The overwhelming majority of people who experience side effects experience the flu for 24 hours and its resolvable with fluids and tylenol. Your COVID experience is not indicative of your vaccine reaction. The needle is so small that most people don't require bandaids (though they all get one) and you wouldn't be able to see the injection mark a day later. Women who experience irregular periods after COVID all report resolution of the issue within a few months and we haven't seen any long term effect on fertility. I know you're hearing a lot and that is scary and unknown, but really, incidences of reactions are absurdly rare. \n\nSo.. why get vaccinated if you had COVID and the risk of reinfection is low? 1. We don't know for sure you had COVID unless you had a positive test. 2. We don't know you have antibodies (even after infection, not everyone gets them, only a blood assay would tell you) 3.

I really appreciate the information about reinfection. I did have a positive COVID test in January. \n\nI did not think I had COVID to begin with, because as I said my only symptom was a headache. I had started back to school and was on my computer a lot but had lost my anti-blue light glasses, so I thought that was the cause of my headaches. However, on day 5 on constant headache I woke up and my eyes looked and felt like they were going to pop out of my head. \n\nI googled something like \u201cmy eyes feel swollen\u201d and the first thing that popped up was \u201cswollen eyes a trending search in places with rising cases\u201d so I knew I had it.

We're still unsure how long they stick around and at what level. And remember what I said about reinfection- that rate is for SEVERE cases, which it sounds like, from what you're saying, yours wasn't (even though it sucked and sounds scary). And those studies were conducted before Delta, and based on everything we're learning, I doubt that study will hold true now. \n\nImmunity is not written in stone. It differs from person to person. Some people might form a great immunity response from a mild COVID case, and some people might not form antibodies from a 2 dose vaccine. This is why opinion differs on whether you should get one vaccine or 2 vaccine doses after infection.Ideally, you get both, but I think doctors are just happy to get atleast one in you to boost your immunity. The better your immunity, the less affected you are by COVID and the better your shot at fighting infection altogether.\n\nWhat I propose to you is this: get one dose and see how you do.

Why are there people in the scientific community that are antivaxxers? \n\nBecause science is a big tent. Not all scientists are the same. For instance, it turns out that chiropracty is founded in anti vaxxing. Like, its part of the origin of chiropracts, which is why so many aren't vaccinated. Without being a dick about it, nurses are not, for all practical purposes, highly educated.

Diagnose you with cancer? No. Its also why 9 out of 10 dentists recommend gum. Because the idea of uniformity, atleast to 100% is never a thing. There are some doctors that believe in Qanon. There are scientists that believe in crystals and aliens. There is Rand Paul. What you can rely on is that often, what MOST people think in their area of expertise is likelier to be true. So that most qualified physicians and scientists agree on vaccines, and on these vaccines, is trustworthy. \n\nSecond, you have eyes, you have ears, you have a brain.

How many have gotten COVID since being vaccinated? Don't tolerate any \"I heard of a guy\" or \"my brothers cousin....\". Just the person in front of you, a first hand account. The reality that we know is that 99.5% of vaccinated individuals do NOT die of COVID and do not suffer hospitalization or severity. And that 80% or more do not get infected with COVID at all.

The CDC has said Delta is \u201clikely more severe.\u201d U.K. data has suggested Delta is more likely to lead to hospitalization than Alpha, but that could be due to increased transmissibility rather than it being more pathogenic.\n\n&gt;An analysis of 38,805 sequenced cases in England revealed that the Delta variant was associated with a 2.61 times higher risk of hospitalisation within 14 days of specimen date than the Alpha variant. There was a 1.67 times higher risk of A&amp;E care within 14 days. These figures take into account factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, area of residence and vaccination status. Data from Scotland supported the findings, also pointing to a more than twofold higher risk of hospitalisation for those infected with the Delta variant compared with the Alpha variant.\n\nThey also found that people who were vaccinated survive better against the delta than people who were previously infected:\n\n&gt;In a study released in Nature on July 8, French researchers tested unvaccinated people who had survived a bout of COVID-19 in order to study how well antibodies produced by natural infection, as well as vaccines, can neutralize Delta. Antibodies from those who were previously infected did not neutralize Delta very well, but a single dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca dramatically boosted their antibody levels.\n\nThey go on to explain why the greater transmissibility  is itself an exponential threat - that an increase in transmission winds up with many many more infections over a short time period.\n\nThey probably should point out that  more infections eats into hospital capacity which also adds to the danger.", "Lol.

When talking through this process with people, I take a few things into account. \n\nI think your choice is really smart, and I appreciate that you're willing to revisit your decision. Delta is scary, and I think its just a harbringer of what's to come. I'm just exhausted of all of this and want it to end as soon as possible, and this is how we do it. COVID is tricky and don't care about your precautions.. it'll hospitalize a healthy 22 yr old and a 70yr old cancer patient will have a mild incidence. Sure, there are odds to take into account, but the spread of this virus now is just.... terrifying. \n\nSo... which to choose. \n\nFirst of all, efficacy. If there are no other factors, you go with highest efficacy, and that's a 2 shot solution. Pfizer or Moderna, and I don't feel there's much difference. Pfizer has much wider distribution, so if the amt of testing, etc is a concern, I'd go with Pfizer. \n\nSince that's not the only factor, I usually ask about things like sex and age. The incidence of side effects are so small as to be not worth weighing, but if all other things are equal, it might make sense for young men to avoid 2 shot solutions due to the risk of myocarditis, or young women to avoid J&amp;J due to blood clots. You have neither of these risks (and again, while I allow room for people's anxiety, these are not worth much time to their absurd low incidence). \n\nSo, obviously, you need to make your own decision, but I like the mRNA options and would recommend Pfizer. I would also recommend getting it at a clinic over a pharmacy, since they're more likely to distance/mask in a clinic. I absolutely believe people are getting infected at vaccine sites that are inside without masking or distancing, like many pharmacies. \n\nI'm glad you survived COVID and don't' seem to be having long term effects, but the great news is that those who do have long term effects, often report improvement after being vaccinated. \n\nIf you need additional support, or want to talk more, just send me a chat.

Note the additional factors. \n\n&gt;The changes were more pronounced for individuals who received the Moderna vaccine (on both doses), those who previously tested positive to COVID-19 (on dose 1), and for individuals aged &lt;40 years, after adjusting for possible confounding factors.\n\nHere's my thought for you. I don't have the bandwidth, but I'd look for two things: \n\n1. Are there published, peer reviewed studies of the effect of the vaccines on smokers? \n2.

But THIS COVID, Delta is different. This is twice as contagious, and is hitting people your age. They get sick faster, harder. \n\nOn the other side, you have... MAYBE some short term elevated heart risk. Maybe. And yes, you have elevated heart rate already from smoking. But a short term heart rate issue that you're already aware of, that might not even happen, that you can treat with a doctor or watch... \n\nI think, honestly, and I say this empathetically.. that because of the trauma you've been through, you're fixating on this perceived risk. Its missing the forest for the trees. Your risk is COVID. A vaccine presents far, far less risk.", "Ain't that the truth. I seem to clot easy and I'm berated for not getting the vaccine.

So the MRNA vaccine is not a new technology at all. It\u2019s been there for a while like since the 1980s . The concept was first devised by dr. Peter cullis in UBC. There was few clinical trials as early as 2003, but as it\u2019s always with science. It never became popular because of funding. So A-) mRNA is not experimental. So for the common misconception about the MRNA vaccines. The MRNA is a messenger ribonucleic acid, the codes for the covid\u2019s glycoproteins, the key it uses to enter the cells. The mRNA gets expressed by your cellular machinery inside the cytosol and doesn\u2019t touch your DNA. Now the cell having expressed the virus protein will get recognized by your immune system and voila you have built immunity. mRNA is very unstable chemically and gets degraded by various enzymes so it\u2019s very safe and we don\u2019t need to worry about long term effects", "As for vaccines with a viral vector, they carry DNA in attenuated viruses.

One committed su!c*de and one suffered cardiopulmonary arrest (ie heart stopped beating/low O2). \n-Severe infection was only noted in those who didn\u2019t get the actual vaccine. \n\nNow, since the variants are still (relatively) new, there just isn\u2019t going to be great data on how the vaccine combats those infections.

Highlights of this study include:\n\n-mRNA vaccines decreased the likelihood of extreme illness \n-the vaccine decreased the amount of time to fight the virus (ie less time sick and less time to transmit). \n\nIn terms of long term safety, there isn\u2019t much data, but, the history of vaccines indicate that if a bad reaction is going to happen, it\u2019s gonna happen 2 months after the vaccine. (Source https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine).\n\nBut, something to remember is that we don\u2019t truly know the long term impacts of covid either.

When I use the word \u201cdrugs\u201d I can be referring to Tylenol (which can be purchased over the counter) or to prescription drugs (which require the oversight of a physician), but I can also be referring to illegal drugs (such as meth). Which I am referring to will depend entirely on context; generally, when someone uses the word \u2018drugs\u2019 they have a specific meaning in mind rather than all three. The word pharmakeia is much the same. It has a range of meanings. It can refer to magic, but it very often refers to the practice of medicine or what might be called healing arts (see Liddell and Scott, a Greek-English Lexicon). It does not refer to both of these things at the same time. It depends on context. In the New Testament the word pharmekeia occurs three times (Gal 5:19-21; Rev 9:21; 18:23). Each time, it is translated as \u2018sorcery\u2019 or \u2018magic\u2019 and it is something that is spoken of in negative terms. The translators have chosen this definition because of the context. This does not mean that every possible definition of the word phramekeia is condemned. It depends on context.\n\n Second, you ask if the practice of medicine is condemned in the New Testament. By no means. There are two verses that point to a positive view of the practice of medicine: \"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.\u201d (Matt 9:12; Mark 2:7; Luke 5:31). Why say that the sick have need of a physician if medicine is condemned? And Colossians 4:14 brings greetings from \u201cLuke, the physician.\u201d Why would Luke\u2019s profession as a physician be mentioned if it were viewed as inappropriate or tantamount to sorcery? The New Testament certainly recognizes that healing can occur in other ways besides through the care of a physician: Jesus is presented as the quintessential healer. Both Mark and Luke tell a story about a woman who had been ill for many years and who had seen many physicians, none of whom were able to help here (Mark 5:26; Luke 8:43). This does not condemn the medical profession; rather it describes the desperate state of the woman.\n\nThird: interpretation for today. Healing is a complex process. Most any physician today would agree with this and I believe such a view is present also in the New Testament. It involves individuals such as family or friends who support us (think of the four friends who carry the paralytic to Jesus); it involves treatment by physicians and licensed mental health care specialists and may include the appropriate use of specific drugs; it involves faith \u2013 that is, trust in God; it also involves our own willingness to engage in actions and activities that promote health.", "Which begs the question-WHY are the uncomfortable with it?  \n\n\nCurrent example....MOST of the people you hear expressing discomfort is over flat-out false claims; \"It's untested.\" \"It has a microchip.\" \"It'll cause ADE.\" \"It's the mark of the beast.\" \"It causes COVID.\" \"It'll sterilize me.\" Etc.  \n\n\nOnce you weed through all that....I think you'll find you have an EXTREMELY small amount of people who aren't comfortable with it.", "Not into the god hypothesis.

It's a weird thing because I've never once felt this way about vaccines, although I don't trust big pharma. My family is full of old people, they want what's best for me and really pressured me into getting it. My only reason for not wanting it was honestly because of all of the commotion and politics involved in this at the moment, at that's not normal. I don't advocate for or against the vax, I never participate in conversation about it. My sister and i sat down for a few hours and read up various scientific articles and ACTUALLY did our research, checked sources, you know the proper way. We ended up getting the shot, we almost didn't get any closer to a decision. Yes- you can still get covid with or without it, and transmit it. But I don't know personally anyone who that's happened to. I do however know people who are currently intubated and have pneumonia- yes most of them are also much older than me. I've never had any pre-existing medical issues and haven't been sick in over 8 years not even a minor cough. I made the decision today to get the shot because I'd rather be safe than sicker, and because the pros seemed to outweigh the cons, for me. I do not believe, and none of the evidence I've looked into shows that the vaccine has a high chance of causing some adverse reaction, to me. At least nothing worth being scared of. I got Pfizer, my arm was sore it went away after doing windmills for 15 mins, vision was very slightly blurred for about an hour but only when reading up close.  That's it there was no other symptom whatsoever. At the end of the day, it's your choice. I did feel very pressured but mostly by my family, everyone just wants what is best for those that they love. If there is some sort of malice behind this whole situation (the worst of course being propaganda and shit), then it's a lot of us sinking in this boat , or maybe the government is full of idiots who thought they were doing their best at promoting this vaccine? Idk- I went with my gut. Because I believe that my body could have fought off the virus alone, but I also think my body can take on any vaccine no matter how good or bad. Good luck to you man. Do your research based on your medical history and don't feel bad if you don't want to do it. Stay safe ! \n\nI will add that I highly support non- medicinal healthcare as in you know, exercise, vitamin D, proper nutrition as the best way to get your body into proper shape and fight off the infection if it had to.

Logically a vaccine is suppose to carry out long term protection or immunity against whatever disease/illness that is and to prevent rather than treat it once you have it.  Sure people look at the covid vaccine and think the more vaccinated the better considering it should make whatever disease/illness difficult to spread because thats how an accurate vaccine works however, like I said before the covid vaccine doesn\u2019t apply data on the safety or efficacy as to preventing or transmitting the virus once you have it (everything in which a vaccine should fight to do) so I was just stating the factual evidence that the vaccine only helps with lower the symptoms and literally NOTHING else which you continue to blatantly ignore.  You cant tell me the vaccine helps prevent the virus because it doesn\u2019t and you also cant tell me you cant transmit it because you most certainly can.  Hence why there are so many conflicting messages about social distancing and wearing masks even after your vaccinated.

PhaseII/phaseIII were concluded in November 18 2020 and were submitted to FDA. To get fully approved there should be post-market drug safety monitoring. That happens with all medications. FDA approval is nuanced  and quite complicated. But the gist of it, the FDA issues emergency use authorization when the benefits outweighs the risks and only in crisis like the pandemic. The FDA would continue to monitor for any potential adverse effects or rare complications, this doesn\u2019t mean they will pull the vaccine out of the market if they found something. this is done usually for dose recommendations and warning labels. There is also the (BLA form) or FDA form 356th which requires facility inspections, summary of information submitted, case reports or rare adverse effects. So where is the vaccine now, when it first got approved under (EAU) the FDA reviewed safety records for the clinical trials which requires all safety data for phase I / phase II and phaseIII + a follow up with phase III participants after two months of the trials. So we know the vaccine is safe .. so what\u2019s missing are those rare side effects that usually comes with a warning label in every medication and BLA form . thus there is no approval. FYI the vaccine manufacturers have already submitted a BLA form and now it\u2019s under FDA review so approval shouldn\u2019t take a long time. So approval or no approval it doesn\u2019t make a difference, we know the vaccine benefits outweighs its risk. Now let me ask you if it got approved will you take it ?

So many people in this world have trouble admitting their fears. Others like my self are terrible at asking for help. In my circle I\u2019m the one who does the helping. I\u2019m naturally good in crisis situations so when I\u2019m the one In Need I always try and do it on my own. Usually that\u2019s a bad I idea and I\u2019m learning to ask. I\u2019m taking a note from you now so you\u2019ve already helped someone else by posting your fears and anxiety so thank you. \n    \n     I read in one of the response follow ups that you\u2019ve learned you are very intuitive and that your intuition tends to serve you well. I fully believe that we are given intuition as our natural way of avoiding impending disaster. It can also serve us to know when someone is lying to us and help in cases of helping others. Intuition is how the spider builds the web. Take the octopus for example. It is not raised by parents or any thing else for that matter it intuitively knows how to hunt and how to avoid being hunted. An octopus will collect shells and rocks from the sea floor roll itself into a ball and all you see is a pile of shells and rocks. It\u2019s an incredible display of intuition. It camouflages itself from its prey and no one taught it to do so. \n\n     Well, being that there are so many sides to this situation to be vaxxed or not to be vaxxed and wether or not you are immune if you\u2019ve had it already and then all the boosters. There\u2019s much too consider. This is exactly why we are givin intuition. I think you should rest easy knowing that with a mask and proper social distancing using sanitizers and not hanging in close proximity with others you are most likely not going to catch or give covid. So you should not feel like you need to make this decision immediately. \n    That being said I would meditate on it and if you believe in a higher power praying is also a good form of meditation. Continue to take feedback from those around you and from this stream. Take in what works for you and discard what doesn\u2019t. This decision is your and yours alone. There are in my belief reasons to be scared. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been given an open book of honesty throughout this whole situation. So don\u2019t feel badly that you are scared. And at the same time very good reasons why taking the vax is the right thing to do. So it\u2019s ok that you are confused. You have every right to feel the way that you do. \n     You are correct that it has been over politicized. That is a shame. Something like this should have nothing to do with politics so it\u2019s unfortunate that it became so. Ask yourself why you feel certain ways. Give adequate research to those answers and move through and  on to the next emotion. \n     I\u2019m confident that being an intuitive individual you will make the right decision for yourself. I\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve suffered panic attacks. I know first hand exactly how terrifying it is to lose control of your own mind snd body. My panic attacks have left me motionless sometimes shaking and with a racing mind filled with what if\u2019s and disastrous situations that are constant and completely out of my control. Usually about one week after I deal with a crisis situation I find myself curled up in a ball or racing to the ER in hopes of some Ativan to calm me down. Panic attacks are very real and very scary. You shouldn\u2019t feel the least bit awkward that you\u2019ve panicked twice in the parking lot. It\u2019s totally natural. \n     Again I commend you for your bravery in posting and asking for help. You\u2019ve truly helped me in doing so and for that I thank you dearly. \n     Be well.

It\u2019s great that we\u2019re not paying out of pocket for the vaccine, but they are definitely still profiting from it.

Yet, I have never had the seasonal flu. I have had several direct covid exposures and have tested negative every time. (And yes, I\u2019ve quarantined after each exposure to protect those around me.) \n-While these vaccines are relatively new, development and research has been in the works for years because, even though most people had never heard of Coronavirus until 2020, it is not a new virus. However, the long term effects cannot be fully known at this time. Do I fully trust I won\u2019t have negative side effects in 10, 20 years?\n-I know my body better than anyone else, even better than the scientists and my doctors. Throughout my adult life I\u2019ve had strange and unexplained reactions to various substances, gone through tests, bloodwork, poking and prodding with no answers. Do I feel confident a vaccine won\u2019t cause any reactions in my unpredictable body? Those who have not had these types of experiences probably feel confident their bodies will not have a bad reaction. \n-Finally, my entire family has recently tested positive for covid. Half of them had been vaccinated. Some of the vaccinated were hospitalized. Some of the unvaccinated were hospitalized. My mother, who is unvaccinated, had the mildest case. This personal experience alone does not give me confidence in the vaccines. \n\nI will continue to do my research (real research, which gets harder and harder to come by), block out the haters on all sides (which is also hard to do), and perhaps I will eventually be able to resolve my uneasy feelings.

You\u2019ve done a good job in making sure if you get the  virus you dont die from it ( which was low to begin with)  the fact that any vaccinated person could bring a symptomatic or asymptotic infection around you and still spread it similar to an unvaccinated person means relax. Let your niece come over and treat her normally.\n\nIf you\u2019re still edgy about the virus make sure you\u2019re discarding the destructive lifestyles that we have in America which lower our immune system also, such as drinking alcohol, low nutrition diets, high stress levels, obesity (scientific term for being over the recommended weight range for your sex, height, and age).\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna believe in science listen to ALL the science. Not just the media that says Covid -9 equals death . Even though the scientific data from who says it\u2019s not a guarantee death sentence. Be healthy. Being vaccinated but obese, high stressed, poor nutrition diet, coupled with large amounts of or processed/fast foods is a refusal to accept all of the science available about our health.

The human body is just unbelievably powerful in healing itself without medical intervention, and western medicine (well, eastern too...) is about processes to diagnose and treat.    It doesn't fit everyone the same way, some things are harder to diagnose. I also think sometimes, people are their own roadblocks. I have a friend who is desperate to get help figuring out what ails her, but is so argumentative and challenging to MDs without giving anything time to work, that I know why she's never been diagnosed. It doesn't change things tho... I know, this is the result of trauma. \n\nI wish that having not had COVID until now was any indicator you won't in the future. But we just don't have the same COVID now that we did before. this is 400% more contagious (and since this is reddit, I'll back that up. Each COVID infection previously infected 2 others, now its 8). Things change. Rapidly, as it happens. Maybe you're a unicorn who hasn't gotten sick because you have some insane immune system. Maybe you were just lucky. As this virus changes, so do your odds. \n\nI like to think of this in terms of humanity.  I often watch these situations on say, instagram or the news and think.... \"what would I do?\".  This morning, i watched someone jump onto a subway track to help rescue someone who'd fallen in. I'm not that person. I'd be the person who helps pull them out. If I saw someone choking, would I run over and help? Yes. I would be that person. Would I put myself between a cop and someone at risk? Yes, I have done that. someone on this board posted about a man who was dragging himself across a parking lot the other day because the hospital staff wouldn't help him and he was scared of exposure. Yes, I would have helped that person.  \n\nAnd the thing in each of those situations that stops us is risk to ourselves. Fear. There's a difference in risk between giving someone the heimlich and standing in front of an angry cop. I wouldn't put myself at risk for nothing. But there's another factor that we balance with risk and fear, which is humanity. I can take these risks for the sake of someone else. I am someone with great privilege, and it is my privilege to confront those fears. \n\nI think of COVID vaccines, masking, and distancing in those terms. Lets put aside the documented risk, I ask myself if I can take this risk to benefit humanity, and what is my fear based in? Long term effects... ok. What if it takes 10-20 years for something to manifest? Well, in 10-20 years a LOT OF PEOPLE would have those effects and medicine would find a solution. Its a risk we can tolerate when we look at the current risk of COVID. Even if you yourself would not get sick (and we don't know that, its a risk, too) its far more documented that it would lead to long term effects on your health than a vaccine. \n\nEven if I don't trust western medicine, you know what they say about Gd in foxholes? If I break a bone or have a gaping wound.. I go to a hospital. Because the body, in all its abilities, can not heal those on its own. Medicine is as complicated as anything else, with beautiful ability and also, risks. If you had COVID and needed it, you'd find yourself at a hospital, where the only drugs they can use are far more experimental than anything in the vaccines.   \n\n\nYour personal experiences aside, you must know others with COVID, had COVID, lost family members, coworkers, etc that have either suffered more than your family, or actually lost people to this. 25% of people with COVID, from mild to severe end up with long term health effects. It just feels like such a HUGE risk to take.   \n\n\nI'm not judging you. I don't do that. Your reasons are salient, and I know you believe them. And yet, I still transparently want you to consider vaccination. Because it helps me, it helps your neighbors, friends, and most importantly, because I believe you deserve to be safe.

In this study, the incidence ranges from 1 in 26,000 to 1 in 533, 333 injections.

On the pandemic and vaccine specifically, obviously the sky is blue and clouds hold condensation that precipitates as rain or snow. \n\nThere are virologists, immunologists, and pathologists that are saying the vaccine is more harmful long term than effective short term. Then there are scientists in the same fields that say the opposite with certainty. All of them are scientists, so which \"science\" is actually factual? The majority of people online don't know, and are not digging deeper in their research to analyze the nuances of these studies and reports. Emotions are charged and influencing decisions and opinions. If people don't agree, there is immediate labeling, shaming, and blaming. I find it especially troubling that dissenting opinions are being censored to hell, that cannot be disputed as it's plain as day. That alone should be concerning enough to question everything we are being told. We need to question the institutions and systems of information. Corporations and companies are massively profiting off of all of this, can we really trust any studies or reports connected to those who earn millions off the vaccine?

Think about actually getting covid and how other people have suffered and died. That is what the vaccine will prevent and that is what makes it worth it.

I help counsel people on these kinds of questions. \n\nWell, we have two questions here. Should you get a vaccine and should you get Pfizer. Lets start with the easy one. \n\nShould you get vaccinated? Yes. COVID does not care that you are young, that you are healthy or what you weigh. While previously, these factors (youth, weight, health) have played a small role in helping to determine how you would survive COVID, delta has changed the parameters of the game. We are seeing younger people, those people are getting sicker, faster. And we now understand that death is not the biggest fear. 25% of people with COVID, no matter how mild or severe, experience long term side effects. Also, I don't know where you live, but .... what's your hospital situation like? Would you even be able to get into one if you needed it? Yes, I'm sure you know people who had COVID and were \"just fine\". That was before. Delta is just different. If you are unvaccinated, it will find you. \n\nThis bullshit about \"it doesn't matter since you can get COVID with the vaccine\" is absurd. The vaccines still prevent 70-80% of infections, and those who are infected don't experience COVID severity. \n\nBesides, those are just the health reasons to get vaccinated. You're a young person, and your passport to the world... to concerts and traveling and doing things is all going to be determined by being vaccinated. \n\nSo now lets turn to whether you should get Pfizer or not. The answer is \"sure\". Lets talk about why: the risk of side effects is absurdly low, and despite everything you read here, if you talk to actual people you know and ask them about THEIR side effects (not their mom or someone they heard about) you will learn they had minimal side effects. Most people have a small flu.  The only notable side effects we know about are these: in J&amp;J, there is an incidence of blood clots. For relativity, its 100 people (mostly women under 50) out of many millions of doses. In Pfizer/Moderna, there is an incidence of cardiac events (myocarditis). For relativity, its 1000 cases for 167 million doses. So in both cases, spectacularly rare. ALSO, in the case of the cardiac issues, 80% of them resolved in a few weeks. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. There are few risks for getting vaccinated. \n2. There are many benefits for getting vaccinated. \n3. Your age/health doesn't matter. \n\nI'm happy to talk more and help you figure out where to get vaccinated, etc. Just shoot me a chat.", "Agree, they will continue to politicize the vaccine sadly.

If everyone is stuck at home and cashing unemployment check every now and then, no one will want to work.

The most common form of pneumonia is preventable by vaccination.  Pneumonia used to be called by doctors \"the old man's friend\" because it ended the suffering of so many aged people.

Guess they couldnt trust their immune systems.", "Of course there is a test since delta was sequenced.  They dont test everyone routinely due to extra expense but they sample enough positives to know delta now comprises the vast majority of new cases in Western countries.", "Hahahahahaha. Best thing I\u2019ve read. They can\u2019t contain COVID but now they have contained the Delta. There is no test. Stop spreading lies. You don\u2019t answer questions.

I also never said anything about measles or those vaccinations. We are talking about the covid shot. You choose to deflect and talk about other irrelevant shit because you can\u2019t argue it. That\u2019s a tactic folks like you do when they have been owned. I\u2019ve been talking about covid this entire time and you sidetrack the convo by bringing up Measles. The measles vaccination has been studied for fucking years. The covid shot has not. Fact. Why are you trying to argue that?  The regular flu shot has been studied half a century and you still got a 60 percent chance of catching it which is why I don\u2019t get flu shots every year. Haven\u2019t had a flu in 6 years.

You guys. Let me catch up. \n\n\"efficacy\" is a complicated idea we've simplified for the purpose of news. But its complicated, right? \n\nThe efficacy we talk about is, first of all, a mean. An average. Each individual person will not gain that efficacy, it will be based on various factors in each individual, like age, health, etc. For instance, I didn't build ANY antibodies because of meds I'm on. \n\nAlso, the efficacy is based on the strain its tested on. So, the 95%ish efficacy was based on the original strain, and prevention of death and hospitalization. \n\nNow, over time, that efficacy diminshes, but not a lot. That's what studies show. But it does diminish. \n\nOver time, we get more strains. And the vaccine wasn't developed for them, it was developed for the original strain. This is not a surprise.... everyone kept saying if you don't get vaccinated, we allow new strains to develop. Well, that happened. \n\nSo now, various countries are measuring efficacy against Delta. Again- efficacy is measured in prevention of death and hospitalization. Israel's doses are older than ours, as I explained above. Someone who was vaccinated last week w Pfizer does not have a low efficacy rate. \n\nBut regardless of ALL of your above diatribe.... I fail to understand how you look at the mortality and hospitalization records and think the vaccines are worthless. 95% of hospitalizations are unvaccinated people. Almost all deaths are unvaccinated. Is that coincidence?", "\"Bearing in mind these are usually the people who cheerfully promote the vaccine every time the subject comes up. Funny how quickly those people are also the first to wash their hands of you when your experience contradicts their preconceptions, rather unscientific I thought.\"\n\nI just watched a video of a retired doctor who fell ill after her first vaccine and is still ill months later. She said that no one would believe it was the vaccine even though her symptoms began 30 minutes after the injection, they all blamed her, they gas lighted her, no one would help her, she tried many doctors in many disciplines and finally got a neurologist who acknowledged it was a vaccine injury, and no one even bother to check in on her to find out if she were still alive.\n\nThe vaccine is safe and effective though and don't you dare say a word to the contrary.", "It is? I thought the latest propaganda was that it was more contagious but less deadly. If young people are suddenly dying, it's due to the vaccine. Unfortunately, we'll be seeing a lot of that in the months ahead as we go into the winter cold and flu season. It's much harder to fight things off when your immunity has been destroyed.", "Corruption in healthcare never went away when covid hit", "Most young people who died of covid were never vaccinated, unfortunarely for them.  They all trusted their immune systems, I guess.", "Yeah, it's one thing not jumping to conclusions, but actually actively denying reality to suit the narrative you've co-fabulated with questionable global organisations (for months!) is just delusional. This is no longer about science but about ideology.", "Look clown, i try to be nice to people no matter how ignorant they are.  I mentioned measles because the MmR was the last major vaccine target of crazed antivaxxers.  Before that these trolls were fighting Tdap, before that polio, before that smallpox.

Yeah that one.", "No because I studied biology in college and medical school, I know there are exactly 2 genders and a few unfortunates with ambiguous genitalia due to unusual hormonal conditions.

All they can do is insult so I dont feed them, just laugh at them.  Which of thr 57 genders do you think you are and what are your pronouns?  How about \"it\"?", "Still deflecting I see. No questions answered but let\u2019s bring up irrelevant shit about measles. Hahahaha. You\u2019re pathetic and weak. That\u2019s why you need shots and boosters next. What\u2019s next?  A new muzzle. I know where you can get a few. I had to put them in your mother over the years.", "Wow. Since you\u2019ve been in Med school you would think it would be easy for you to answer questions regarding this virus instead of dodging them huh? That\u2019s where I will call your bluff. Next.", "I was vaccine hesitant as well. I just got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week. I was hesitant because I thought it was rushed and was waiting on the sample size to be larger. When the Delta variant started its rampage in Florida, I took another look at the numbers and VAERS (official side effect reporting tool if you didn't know) and decided that it was time. No one else could have talked me into it. The choice had to be mine. Even then, I was terrified of the side effects and how it would mix with my medications (I also have Bipolar Disorder). Regardless, I went ahead and got it.\n\nFirst dose: I felt pretty crappy, kind of like a mild case of the flu with a sore arm, but it went away in less than 24 hours.\n\nSecond dose: I felt slightly worse than the first dose, though the symptoms were the same. These also went away within 24 hours. \n\nUltimately, it is up to you. The benefits will have to outweigh the rewards in your mind. You will hear some people say some terrible things about the vaccines on here, but I feel very confident that they are safe and effective. With the Delta variant running rampant, now is a great time to get the vaccine. 99% of the people that are hospitalized and/or dying are unvaccinated. Regardless of your decision, I wish you the best and hope that you don't catch it with or without the vaccine.", "Still fixated on how many genders it has.  I will take up my suggestion on its preferred pronoun.", "Weak. Weak weak. Limp. Weak. Keep at it Mr. Biology and take your boosters.

You are confusing covid, which is a respiratory and vascular disease, with gay bowel syndrome!  P", "I think some people with remaining symptoms have had them flushed out after they had the vaccine (some of my friends included). I don't know if we can for sure conclude it is the vaccine, but there are enough people that it has happened to warrant paying attention/studying it. Either way, that's awesome!", "Again no questions answered. Sitting around with you envisioning that you are a hero because you took a jab. That\u2019s why covid has been great for weak people like you. You can get a shot, be a virtue signaling hero and show everyone you are helping with a cause. But that\u2019s quite the opposite. Instead, you are being an obedient slave. You aren\u2019t a hero. A hero doesn\u2019t get scared of a 99.7 survival rate flu like you did. I\u2019m sure you push the narrative that hundreds of thousands have died from covid when in reality it\u2019s quite low when you factor in just Covid only deaths. So you are obedient to your masters while they push the great reset NWO agenda and take away people\u2019s freedoms by the day. All while you sit on your lazy ass and welcome communism into your country. The end doesn\u2019t pay way for traitors like you pushing false propaganda because let\u2019s be honest, if you knew the answers, you wouldn\u2019t have taken the shot. You would have used critical thinking skills to research and realize that something is very very off with this virus and getting a shot will never return you to normalcy. On the other end of this convo, you have me. I own a very successful covid disinfection cleaning company. Since the pandemic, I have personally cleaned over 240 sites that were all covid positive. I didn\u2019t get the shot. Wore a regular medical mask and gloves. Never caught covid yet here you are bragging about your biology experience and Med school experience but you really haven\u2019t helped anyone in the pandemic. What have you done?  You clean the cities largest covid positive ward at the local homeless shelter like me?  No. You got a shot and now all of a sudden you\u2019re the hero. The great part is I don\u2019t need or want recognition. Just merely pointing out that I\u2019ve been in that field. I\u2019ve cleaned a hospital that the local news said was at capacity in their ICU and it was completely Empty when I was there. You know Deep down in your heart something doesn\u2019t feel right. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t answer my question if you would wear a diaper tomorrow if you had a 99.7% chance you WOULD NOT shit your pants. It\u2019s because you know this pandemic is off. Where did the regular flu go?  Why has the CDC been caught lying so many times. It must suck to be you at this pivotal moment in history. I promise you got the shot to be a virtue signaling hero and to be out in public and not wear a mask but yet your masters lied to you. Your life hasn\u2019t been normal after the shot. You stay up at night wondering what that MRNA is doing in your body and when those proteins are gonna stop spiking in your body.

Most babies pass out of the Freudian anal stage of development at age three, at which point the distinction becomes clear to them, except perhaps for those with an imperforate anus whose parents never got it fixed.  Such surgery might be beyond the competence of the quacks you see like Dr Mercola.", "1. The most recent studies show that the viral load in vaccinated person is far less than in unvaccinated.\n2. If a vaccinated person comes in contact with COVID they recover more quickly and often are less symptomatic so they aren't coughing/spewing/sniffing/hacking as much as an unvaccinated person who is COVID positive, therefore they are less contagious and spreading fewer particles.  Not to mention their body more quickly wins out against COVID so they may only be active with any for a very short period of time whereas an unvaccinated person is more likely to be heavily symptomatic and for much, much longer.\n2. Vaccinated people are more likely to mask, distance, and test (and then quarantine if the come up positive)", "I was patiently explaining the rationale for the Vaccine Act and mentioned a list of diseases which vaccines protected children against.

Consequently, in his mind, this would \u2018create\u2019 new, more dangerous variants,\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Stoilov pointed out that \u201cselection does not cause new variants to emerge; it merely selects some of them.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMutations and variants occur randomly and independently of vaccination or any other selection process. In fact, they may precede selection by years or millennia,\u201d Stoilov said.\r  \n\r  \nHe further explained that the mutations defining the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern emerged before vaccines were created or became widely available.\r  \n\r  \nHe added that they emerged in multiple independent unvaccinated individuals from across the globe, and they continue to reoccur randomly in unrelated lineages of the virus.\r  \n\r  \nStoilov said it\u2019s a well-established fact that selection does not cause mutations.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe facts that Dr. Montagnier ignores are that, while vaccination may select for some variants, it is still effective at suppressing them and the overall effect is a dramatic reduction of infections and a milder disease when the virus manages to break through the vaccine,\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \nStoilov said that Montagnier is not only mistaking correlation for causation with his claim, but that he isn\u2019t even using a viable correlation to make the argument.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe variants of concern frequency increase correlates to some degree to the onset of vaccination. But, this is the same as claiming that pirates are causing global warming. This correlation merely reflects the similar times it took for the virus to mutate and spread, and for us to develop the vaccines and start applying them,\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \nIf vaccines were creating new dangerous variants, then Stoilov said we would see proportionately more new variants emerging over time among vaccinated populations than with unvaccinated parts of the world.\r  \n\r  \nThere would also be a lot more diversity among the virus variants in countries with high vaccination rates, and increased disease spread and mortality among vaccinated people.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe see nothing of that. In fact, we see exactly the opposite,\u201d Stoilov said. \u201cIn places with high vaccination rates, the case numbers and mortality are dropping; virus diversity is limited to few (one to three) variants; and, so far, no new variants are emerging among vaccinated populations.\u201d  \n\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health-news/no-vaccines-do-not-cause-new-sars-cov-2-variants#block-a878f2dc-2f9b-4773-9fbc-a2f4ab3cb753", "You have a higher chance of dying or being injured from covid than dying or being injured from the vaccine.

That means people who eat glyphosate in their diet, pass on something that will affect future generations. **Their children, their grand children and great-grand children, they will suffer.** At the moment, this has been only shown in rats. You could extrapolate this onto humans. There are **epigenetic effects**. We need to consider that and not just think of our own generation, but of the future.\n\nThis Messenger RNA that\u2019s being injected today in vaccines, may have effects on future generations that are undetected if we aren\u2019t searching for them. \u2014\n\nSo it will persist, we\u2019ll say, if we inject this substance, without really knowing the without knowing the mid-term and long term consequences.\n\nAbsolutely.

That\u2019s impermissible.\n\nThey will suffer from side effects, to which there have been no observations, or any data from previous studies because it\u2019s still too soon to say.\n\nExactly. There could side effects that effect future generations as well, maybe, but most probably from our generation in five to ten years. That\u2019s absolutely possible.

My new landlord here in Tampa area got so sick he wanted to go to the hospital but his niece who is a nurse told him he\u2019d be worse off at the hospital.

Currently there is also only a single covid patient in the hosptial again giving the impression that our health system isnt as  overloaded as claimed daily in the media...and we live close to a big city  \n\n\nI think this played alot into our impression of it...imagine going nearly two years while permanent contact into a hospital and not seeing much of Covid happening neither in the job nor in family and friends. it just leaves you with the impression that if you avoid groups of people..partying and stay with your close ones and exclusively in nature you are not at such a high risk. i know it's worse at other places. but again a distrust in media doesnt help with that.I'd rather take no risks at all. i had a near death experience in my life and i avoid everything that could somehow be a threat to my health or to my loved ones.  \n\n\nRegarding the second question it's simply alot like. i see the vaccine as a possible health threat. i know of cases people have died very fast without the chance of beeing saved. i know covid is very dangerous aswell but doesnt need to end in a bad case it get's hard to see what is the bigger threat.  \nConsidering i would definitly get it at some point i would gio for the vaccine. but considering i wouldn't get it (which is the case so far) and i manage to avoid it for long enough the shot would be a higher risk. i think i need to factor in more that covid is going to stay with us forever. i kind of also wonder why they have removed the statistics how much of our population already had been infected once...that would kind of give a good impression on how big the actual risk of getting it is.  \n\n\nYour J&amp;J argument ist also pretty decent.

(Natural immunity is a lot stronger than the vaccine in the long term but the boosters are showing to be very beneficial but we need to see how Israel deals with the booster) The reason I state this is that booster shots will probably be required annually to keep immunity up and if you skip or deny the booster it could raise your chances of mortality up 6-8 months after initial dose. \n\n5) COVID vaccine has a pretty great scientific backing from all over the world.

I would like to know what the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis is in males age 0 to 35 years or so; the incidence in the entire population is not helpful. They are apparently treating it successfully, but the medical case histories I have read are of successful treatment: they are publishing so that other doctors are informed about how to treat it. How many were not treated successfully? How many did not get any treatment because no one understood what the problem was, or the chest pain and tachycardia got attributed to anxiety? I would feel more comfortable if there was a dose reduction for young healthy males, or possibly an anti-inflammatory drug that prevents it (if there is one) that could be taken for a week or whatever.\n\nIn Florida, community spread is running wild, so here, a young male is safer taking the vaccine, because getting Covid and having heart or other damage is probably a much higher risk than the vaccine. But in Canada, with low community incidence the risk/benefit ratio may be different. I don't have data to really analyze that.\n\nAlso, it has not been quantified yet, but the vaccines do not reduce the spread appreciably. And because vaccinated people may be more inclined to be more social now that they are vaccinated, they may be (behaviorally) spreading it more, as in the Cape Cod outbreak. I have not seen data on that issue in general, but there certainly is a great deal of documented spread by vaccinated people. \n\nThe major advantages of the vaccine are that it prevents serious illness in most people, and thereby reduces the burden on the hospitals, where people with other medical problems are now dying because they can't be admitted or can't get a needed surgical procedure because the hospital is overwhelmed with Covid patients. That situation has become alrming in Florida.\n\nOverall I think the vaccine is the safest way to go, even with the young males, and even if your area has low Covid numbers. Because Delta is way more dangerous and more lethal than the early variants, and it is spreading so quickly that it probably will be problematic in your area soon.", "If you would have actually read the guidance, you would have seen that the bottom of the practice advisory (i.e., guidance to OB/GYN docs) has all 46 sources that ACOG used in the process of developing and justifying their practice advisory.\n\nWhy don't you trust ACOG on issues of obstetrics and gynecology? What in their past history has given you reason to mistrust them? Please be specific.", "Gotcha.\n\nI mean ya, in the absence of these studies the only thing I have to go off of is official recommendations and anecdotal evidence. And to be honest with you the anecdotal evidence still weighs on my mind, here's what I know:\n\n\\- I've really only met a few people who have described COVID as a walk in the park. For most, it seemed a pretty nasty virus that wreaked havoc on them for weeks at a time. The two most concerning things I heard (each of which I only heard once) were: I had trouble breathing and my mind was cloudy for awhile afterwards. \n\nAs well, I knew one person, aged 55, who died from COVID.\n\nThat being said (and I know people will want to discount this but it's just the truth), I know 4 people who suffered serious side effects from vaccination -- all young to middle aged men. There 2 who died of heart attacks (late 20s), one who was hospitalized (late 20s), and another hospitalized (late 30s). As well, my girlfriend's mom fainted 4 times over a period of 3 months following her 2nd dose. As well, I knew a guy who's body got crazy swollen for 2 weeks like he was pregnant, dude was in super good shape too. \n\nSo I'm sorry to say, but these official \"talking points\" just aren't good enough. It sounds weird to say, but I'll be relieved for the younger aged vaccine participants when I see a study that shows infection with COVID greatly reduces life expectancy via permanent damage. Sounds cruel to say, but that's just to counteract the possible cruelty that is subjecting young men to serious side effects from the vaccine at a greater rate than long term COVID complications.\n\nWish this never happened, and I wish people weren't turning on one another over it. Let's put the blame where it belongs -- on the \"accidental\" lab leakers.   \n\n\nThanks for your time.", "I'm trusting Dr. Fauci on this one (CDC). I don't always trust the government or the FDA, but this time I'm choosing to take their word for it. They're literally begging people to get it; it's probably quicker than explaining how viruses work. I would suggest researching viruses and past epidemics. There's always some kind of pattern, even if this pandemic is a little different from the last one.", "Thanks for your answer, it's very informative.\n\nI didn't consider the amount of people dying or suffering because they can't get surgery, that is indeed alarming because young adults need surgery often as well. In Canada that would be a major concern, our surgery waitlists are horrendous.\n\nAs well, I identify that we may be lagging in our children-death-from-delta-statistics, though delta is definitely here and spreading like wildfire in Toronto and the bigger cities.\n\nThe reason I became concerned about the side effects from the vaccine was actually based on anecdotal (quasi-empirical) evidence. I've known 2 people who have died from heart attacks from the mRNA vaccines, as well as 2 who were hospitalized. Age range was 25-40 all male. Those findings haven't been released to the public yet, but my greater network of acquaintances is not over 27,000 people, so I'm failing to reconcile this apparently high incidence in my \"circle\". These people were not close to me FYI, so I can't verify to a 100% extent what I've been told. 2 of the reports came from friends of mine who are pro-vaccine, one of whom is a very adamant proponent of vaccination. \n\nRegarding surgery wait times, it's my hope our society is better prepared for the next pandemic by actually getting into the root-causes for surgery. I've been extremely effected by this pandemic, I have a bi-lateral inguinal hernia surgery that has been delayed for 2 years, it is congenital so it has absolutely nothing to do with my lifestyle. In a system where the top 10 visits to the clinic are for people who have hypertension, diabetes, and other complications from poor lifestyle, diet, smoking, drug abuse, etc, the need for surgery is a natural extension and consequence of these healthy-lifestyle-shortcomings. That's also the same group that is statistically (78-97%) occupying the hospital with COViD. To be honest with you, when it comes to greater good and moral equivalency, I'm upset that our system supports the \"fatassness\" of our respective nations because it's profitable to have sick people. That's the real crux of this issue, and I know we're in the middle of it so there's no time to adjust, but I really really hope this changes something for society going forward. I mean I'm so adamant about this because I was already ignited over it in Canada well before this pandemic, it's my opinion that if you use more services due to lifestyle decisions you should either pay more or actually have to wait longer.  They've got it backwards, I've been relegated because they view me as young and healthy, but it makes no sense because my bowel is about to rupture and I have my whole life ahead of me. I've lost 10 pounds waiting for surgery because I eat less so as not to inflame my hernia while I wait for my 2nd consult (first one was cancelled due to COVID fears). \n\nI've strayed a little from our original topic but the point being is, this situation is a mess and it will need remediation well beyond the course of COVID.\n\nI thank you for your civilized discourse. I think that's an integral component to progress in society. I'm vaccinated, but I'm worried about the long term effects and especially worried for young males who are seemingly ending up in the ER too often.

It's always done because they think they will scare people. I have little patience or tolerance for the myriad of excuses that people give for not getting vaccinated- except this one, myocarditis in young men. My son is older now, but if I had a 17 year old son I would be considering this carefully. My husband, his father got myocarditis at around age 39. It was mild, and they attributed it to flu, but it led to chronic atrial fibrillation which never reverted to normal rhythm.

And that\u2019s why they\u2019re going to the hospital at a rate higher than you might naively hope. Among Israeli adults under 50, as of Aug. 15, 3.5 million were vaccinated and 1.1 million were not. That\u2019s still a considerable number of vaccine holdouts. Among those 3.5 million vaccinated younger people, just 11 were hospitalized \u2014 about three per million. Meanwhile, of the unvaccinated in this age range, 43 were in the hospital, or 39 per million.\n\nNote that hospitalizations of young people for both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are low, because younger people rarely suffer the severest illness from covid-19. Still, vaccination reduced the rate of hospitalization more than 10-fold in the population under 50.\n\nNow look at the population 50 and older. There are 2.1 million vaccinated Israelis over 50, and 290 were in the hospital Aug. 15. That\u2019s 136 per million, a rate that dwarfs anything younger people are experiencing. And unvaccinated older Israelis? There are very few people in that category: just 186,000. But of that group, 171 were hospitalized \u2014 a grievously higher rate of 919 per million.

People vaccinated in January had a 2.26 times greater risk for a breakthrough infection than those vaccinated in April.

I only get one chance at life and I'm not giving it up for the average age of death group of 80+ year olds if I'm a young man with a higher chance of side effects from vaccine than from COVID.\n\nAnd that moral equivalency is a super slippery slope, how about you give up your child for the greater good in China?\n\nHow about you put down your slurpee, your pepsi, your french fries, your hamburger chains, your cigarettes, your alcohol, since all of those things seem to overburden the social healthcare systems in the long run?\n\nAnd if you're vaccinated, and so are all of the high risk groups, what do you care if this dissenting 22 year old decides to isolate and try out his natural immunity? Are you going to hold him responsible for the development of variants? You don't think you're now over-interacting, non-symptomatic, viral-load carrying vaccinated group is going to lend itself to variants? Go ahead and ask a medical virologist if that's possible, I'll wait for one that gives you the time of day and a straight answer.\n\nAnd no, there's currently no data to support the argument you're making. There's not a higher chance of bloodcots from COVID than from vaccination for a 22 year old man. If you have data that specifically adjusts for comorbidity and false-linkages to reveal that after that adjustment this young man has a higher risk of complications from COVID than from vaccination, both now and in the long term, go ahead and share it. \n\nHe's on the fringe of 0-19, and he's actually in the highest incidence of heart inflammation from vaccination age group as a 22 year old. That's the truth, don't believe me? Look it up. His chances of death from COVID after adjusting for comorbidities is at most, 1/90,000 (unadjusted for COVID \"linked\" deaths and comorbidities). Where as his chances for heart inflammation are, best case, 1/27,000 -- though once adjusted for age probably less than 1/10,000. Which shouldn't be surprising since the healthiest age group is going to have the strongest-immuno-response. Remember the Spanish Influenza? That's right, it killed 25 year olds predominantly. Do you know why? It's because their strong immuno-response is what killed them. Still no protocol for anti-inflammatory medication to be administered to this age group, the medical profession is lagging behind on a sloppy, lack of foresight roll-out. Don't believe me? Why don't you look at the history of all of their false predictions. What exactly is the efficacy of this vaccine, and what percentage of the population needs to be immunized in order for \"herd immunity\" to take effect? Does having imperfect vaccination pave the way for deadlier pathogens to grip and take hold of you? No? Are you sure? Are you extra sure? Go ask that to the virologists. The truth is they've been placing generalized bets, and their predictions have fallen extremely short to the point where with more time they seem to be more wrong than the previous month. I wouldn't be confident as a 22 year old getting this vaccine, with a clear picture of side effects still being developed.   \n\n\nPersonally, I know 2 dead young men from vaccination. And 2 hospitalized with inflammation of the heart. News of all of them came from vaccine proponents within my network. I do not currently know anyone beneath age 55 who has died from COVID and that makes sense because IT'S EXTREMELY RARE.  \n\n\nI didn't say I was smarter than anyone but I will eloquently point out you're not competition if you want to get personal.   \n\n\nYou may indeed but advocating for the right actions, but your understanding of the dilemma for this young man is ill-formed, if I were you I'd stop pressing CAPS LOCK and accept that there are some intelligent people who aren't going to blindly subscribe to non-age-specific-guess that encompasses a high death rate among an aging population. When the data comes in proving long term side effects from COVID for his age group and a greater incidence of that (including death) over long-term side effects from vaccination, that'd be the point where you could be as confident as you seem. Until then it's a guess, and I'd just challenge this young man to at least ask the question, because the 2 people I know who are dead, and the 2 who are hospitalized aren't getting another shot at this question.
